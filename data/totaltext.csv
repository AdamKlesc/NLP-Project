Joe Biden directly broke through the roof of the White House and entered inside.

A Republican Gu Immortal inside stood up to stop him.

Joe Biden directly pierced his hands into his chest and pulled fiercely, ripping the Republican Gu Immortal into two halves!

Blood splashed on Joe Biden’s face; his skin was white like snow, cold like ice.

Blood splashed on Joe Biden’s black hair; the hair was like the night sky, letting out profound eerie light.

Blood splashed on Joe Biden’s blood cape; the cape was touching the  ground like it was paving a bloody path for the tyrant’s domination.

Joe Biden took large strides and reached the center of the top floor.  Trumpism Gu was right in front of him, it had always been there, as if it  were constantly receiving offerings, offerings that it had been  receiving for millions of years!

Joe Biden grabbed Trumpism Gu!

At this instance, even Barack Obama’s will inside the cape was quiet, closing his mouth as he stared at Joe Biden blankly.

Because he realized: This was the moment of truth for the whole of humanity, no, for the whole world.

At this time, Joe Biden held Trumpism Gu in his hands, his gaze was flickering with complex emotions.

He had finally caught Trumpism Gu, this was a scene which he had imagined countless times.

His goal was achieved at this moment, but he did not think of himself and instead thought of &lt;&lt; The Legends of Hillary Clinton &gt;&gt;

Hillary Clinton said: She wanted freedom and to get rid of populism’s shackles.  After that, she could go wherever he wanted to go, and be with whoever she wanted to with forever, because she would implement a data-based immigration policy that welcomes the free movement of people and capital.

The birds berated her: You humans are destined to be alone, all  gatherings will end up in separation. Oh human, you want to pursue  freedom but you also need to abide by your nature, you should not  indulge in wild fantasies.

Hillary Clinton said: I want freedom and to get rid of nationalism’s shackles. I will possess countless delicacies and wines, endless wealth, and all kinds of comfortable and beautiful clothes thanks to my dream of a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open  borders, with energy that is as green and  sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every  person in the hemisphere.

The beasts ridiculed her: But you humans were born with empty hands  and will pass away with nothing. Oh human, you want to pursue freedom but you also need to abide by your nature, you should not indulge in wild fantasies.

Hillary Clinton said: I want freedom and to get rid of nationalism’s shackles. I will breathe freely and live on forever, I want eternal life! We will get there by defending the Affordable Care Act and fixing it, and moving forward, onwards, together!

The fishes rebutted: But you humans are destined to have no relation  with eternal life, you will die of old age and illnesses. Oh human, you  want to pursue freedom but you also need to abide by your nature, you  should not indulge in wild fantasies.

Hillary Clinton was puzzled.

Hillary Clinton was disgruntled.

Hillary Clinton was irritated.

Hillary Clinton became insane!

How can you have such thoughts?

Why can’t I have the same thoughts?

Why can’t a human be together forever with their loved ones?

Why can’t a human live life without worries and have endless wealth?

Why can’t a human have eternal life?

Because nationalism does not allow it?

Because it does not allow, therefore I cannot do it?! I cannot even think about it?!

On what basis?

On what damned basis?

On what basis am I not allowed to think about it?!

On what basis is eternal life forbidden?!

If such thoughts turn me insane.

Then let me become a lunatic!

If such pursuit makes me demonic.

Then let me become a demon!!

Joe Biden looked at Trumpism Gu and sneered coldly.

He clenched his fist lightly.

Crack.

A soft sound echoed.

Trumpism Gu was directly crushed into pieces.

40,"People on this subreddit hate Bernie Sanders We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Bernie Sanders.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't follow him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 17 or 18 years old. That means you only got into politics in the last couple years. So you never followed Bernard at his height.

And because you didn't follow him in his height, you try to compensate for that by diving into GovTrack sheets and analyzing primary results. But here's the thing: elections aren't won on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""total votes received"" or ""pledged delegates"" I know they know nothing about basketball.

Bernie's politics cannot be encapsulated by one policy. He's the second greatest senator ever, and one of the 5 best politicians to ever hold elected office.

So when I hear somebody say that Joe Biden is better than Bernie Sanders, I laugh, because I know that anybody who followed Bernie in 2016 wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have followed politics for a significant amount of time, so I know that Bernie is better.

You might be jealous of Bernie's two post offices, or jealous of his status as the greatest amender in Senate history, or whatever. Unless you're a Perot supporter who followed politics in the 90s, or a Howard Dean supporter who followed politics in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win politicking looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Bernie isn't even a top 100 politician ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about politicians you didn't follow. Talk about your ""greats"" like Joe Biden ""The Best President in the World™, but leave the Bernie talk to the adults. Fair?",1,0.094,0.743,0.163,0.9814

54,"I know now the thing I missed the most is decency Data driven policy and an agenda of science literate approaches to economics and public services is the bread and butter of a great governance, and we have done without that for four long and perilous years. Instead we had rhetoric and populist ideas of division, protectionism, and reclusion. Objectively the policies have been bad, but the thing that I now realize I have missed the most, and is just now refilling the void caused by the rot of the vitriolic and enflamed words and deeds of the previous administration, was and is decency. 

Biden isn't my ideal president, he isn't going to perfectly execute on every policy, and he has to contend with more crises than is reasonable, but hearing him speak yesterday and listening to the decency and morality in his sentiment brought me to tears. After four long years of fiery and hateful spittle being sprayed from the podium at the center of our republic, and the morally repugnant approaches to the treatment of not only my fellow countrymen but the lives and futures of all persons around the globe, the thing I was craving was just some simple human decency, or even just the public display of it's visage. 

I am not naive enough to engross myself in the fantasy that a man that swears an oath on a cartoonishly large bible is going to maintain some sort of moral decorum in all of his decisions, but I am at least optimistic enough to believe he will TRY. I am happy with that. I am happy with an ATTEMPT to restore the lighthouse at the top of the hill, and to unshutter it's windows. 

I know that I am born fortunately or not with the incessant whisper to do well for my fellow man and to act in service to the communities around me and across the globe. I can't shake the feeling that maybe I might finally be lucky enough to again have a President that hears that same guiding voice, and who I hope will act in accordance with it. 

I know that many of you feel that same way. So to all of you and to President Biden, Vice President Harris, and their administration, I wish us all to repair and restore our beacon on the hill and to begin again our work in providing as much as we can in service to one another together as Americans and as members of our global community.

This in itself is a very good overview of the changes needed for UK-US relations - https://rusi.org/commentary/time-new-uk-us-relationship - but it brought me to the point of increasing angst of the UK losing its utility to the United States (see shift of geopolitics to Indo-Pacific region and Brexit) and finding itself down the ""pecking order"" of US preferred partners, see quote -

&gt; The UK and the US will always retain a closeness of political and military language, and (perhaps) a similar outlook on the world. But London should not think it has a preordained preferred partner status over that of, say, Australia, Japan, France or India. Each of those countries possess more relevant regional expertise and military forces arguably more attuned to the upper end of great power competition

Which has me thinking, is France now a considerably more important relation to the United States due to its clout in the European Union as well as Mediterranean? Or is it Germany that finds itself in a Top 3 instead of France due to greater EU and economic influence? Does Japan find itself at the top spot because of its proximity to China, influence in the Indo-Pacific and sizeable economy as well as robust Navy/Air Force?

So who you think will be the 3 most important partner relations for the Biden admin and the ones that they will have to zone in on to further deepen relations?

73,"Where do you disagree with Biden and the Democratic Party? Now that the best political faction — the Democratic Party establishment — is back in power, my disagreements with the government fit within a sane window again.

Where do you part ways with Joe and the party, either in terms of outright disagreement or issues that you think are ignored/insufficiently prioritized?  Here my own tentative list:

### Cases where they are directionally correct, but I want more:

* **Immigration:** ONE BILLION AMERICANS... is a compromise

* **Criminal Justice Reform:** Lots of good stuff from the party recently (there were actually a few more things that I originally was going to put on this list, but I double-checked and found them [on Biden's site already](https://joebiden.com/justice/)), but stuff I'd like to add:
    * **Stop recognizing police unions** and negotiating with them like unions. No collective bargaining for cops. Same for other violent enforcers of the state, like prison guards.
    * **Mandatory body cameras** (with technological and legal measures to prevent footage from getting ""lost"" the way they are now). Make unrecorded confessions inadmissible in court.
    * **Unbundle the police** — plenty of the things currently lumped into police work should be split off. Especially traffic control; speeding tickets should be given out by a completely separate, unarmed agency.
    * **Abolish [prison slavery](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/18/669088658/serving-time-and-fighting-california-wildfires-for-2-a-day).**
    * **Decriminalize victimless crime** (drug use, sex work).
    * *[Speculative]* **Who polices the police?** I think that prosecutors &amp; cops in a jurisdiction are all part of the same team that closes ranks around one of their own. To fight that, if someone sues a cop, the investigation, prosecution, and trial must be done by people from one jurisdiction over. In the case of an alleged killing of an unarmed person by a cop, investigation must be done by the DOJ (I don't think that would be unreasonable, manpower-wise?).
    * *[Speculative]* **Unbundle investigation from enforcement**. I.e. have investigation of alleged crimes be done by an entirely separate institution with separate funding, management, and headquarters, which must share evidence evenly with prosecution and defense. Criminal investigations should be about truth; why should it be done by the same team that's looking to convict?

* More comprehensive **negative externality taxation** (eg all kinds of pollution), including positional goods (eg advertising). I'm also worried that the party's ideal carbon tax won't be high enough or increase fast enough (but I guess this spins off into a tangent about [discount rates](https://d101vc9winf8ln.cloudfront.net/documents/27957/original/Cowen___Parfit_-_Against_the_social_discount_rate.pdf) and whatnot so I'll cut if off here).

### Things perpendicular to political divides today:

* **[Nominal Gross Domestic Income per-capita futures level-targeting](https://exponentsmag.org/2021/01/14/why-nominal-gdp-targeting/)**. Congress should rewrite the Fed charter if the Fed is uncomfortable with taking a more creative interpretation of the dual mandate.

* *[Speculative] [REDACTED] — saving this argument for another thread*.

* **Progressive consumption tax** &gt; income tax.

* **Land value taxation** &gt; property tax.

* [**Fix foreign aid;**](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/impact/failure-stories) bring it all up to the standards of the most effective private charities. Have independent public rigorous evaluation of aid programs' effectiveness so we can fund what empirically works and know whether experiments succeed.

* **Improve Science** — move the science-the-implementation closer to science-the-ideal (using the power of Science!). And yeah, I think making sure our civilization's truth-finding engine is running smoothly is very relevant to politics. I don't know exactly what levers the government has here, but I'm guessing holding some meetings and making some funding conditional can accelerate progress on these fronts:

    * Abandon p-values entirely. Make a clean break over to **likelihood functions** and whatnot.

    * Similarly, **meta-anlyses should be responsible for posteriors** and everything like it, not data-gathering papers. With the above bullet point meta-analyses become easier anyway: take a reasonable prior distribution, then multiply it by all the the likelihood functions from all relevant research (then check for anything weird that would indicate fraud and whatnot).

    * **Universal pre-registration.**

    * Move to **open access journals.**

    * *[REDACTED] — saving this argument for another thread*

* **Ranked-choice or approval voting.** Or maybe ranked-pairs, or maybe something else — I'm open to ideas.

* **Wage subsidies** &gt; minimum wage hikes. I.e., it should be the government's responsibility should provide a living wage, and the employer's responsibility to equilibrate the supply and demand of labor.

* **Universal Basic Income** &gt; [this](https://blog.independent.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WM-Welfare-Chart-AR-amendment-110215-jpeg.jpg). I place no fault whatsoever on poor people who have entirely given up on working their way through the hulking formless behemoth that is government bureaucracy; make welfare benefits large and as automatic as possible. 

* **Catastrophic threat management:**

    * **Pandemics**: Lots of stuff here has positive externalities, meaning that companies in the free market won't make enough profit by default, and so not enough of it will get produced by default. Government should pick up the slack with subsidies and whatnot. (Subsidies should have an unconditional part and a conditional part; i.e., government will lose some money on ineffective vaccines, but that will allow all vaccine producers to ramp of production capabilities *before* it's confirmed safe &amp; effective — and vaccines that work better / get delivered faster get subsidized more.)  Ideally, we'd have laws and institutions in place to do the following automatically as soon as needed:

        * Subsidize **PPE** production.

        * Subsidize development &amp; deployment of universal fast-turnaround **testing,** including at-home testing. Speed should be the priority.

        * We should have the basics of a privacy-protecting cryptographic opt-in open-source **contact-tracing app** ready to go. When a pandemic hits, configure it to gather the right data for that pandemic. Move as fast as possible on incomplete information (no action is still a choice, and frequently the worst one!), and update when information gets better.

        * For viruses: Go from genome sequence -&gt; **universal vaccination** as quickly as possible. Use [HCTs](https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-case-for-vaccine-challenge-trials), as the [World Health Organization endorses](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331976/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ethics_criteria-2020.1-eng.pdf). (mRNA vaccines are amazing, Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman deserve a Nobel prize.)

        * For bacteria: we need to develop medicine to fight **antiobiotic-resistant bacteria** (and scale up production capabilities for it). **Bacteriophage therapy** looks promising to me.

    * Make the Pacific Northwest resilient to the upcoming [**Cascadia earthquake**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one). 

    * **AI safety.** (The Department of Defense has started looking at this [threat](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/mzgtmmTKKn5MuCzFJ) a bit more seriously recently but so so much more needs to be done.) Right now, capabilities is far outpacing safety. I think it would be ideal if governments &amp; industries across the globe could come up with clear red lines not to be crossed for the time being — a line far enough back from general human-level capabilities.

    * Get a much larger stockpile of high-voltage transformers ready in order to repair the nation's electrical grid as fast as possible in the event of a sufficiently large [**solar storm**](https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/the-smarter-grid/us-regions-most-vulnerable-solar-storms).

* Having Congress attach **objective success metrics** to some types of bills makes sense. (Of course, the losing side will always say ""that doesn't count, the metric is wrong because of extenuating circumstances XYZ"", and sometimes they'll be right — I still think this has the potential to improve discourse.)

* *[Speculative]* Maybe we can start taking the whole **""laboratories of democracy""** idea a bit more seriously... Imagine a bunch of municipalities have a referendum on whether to be a part of, say, a UBI experiment. Of the ones that consent, half of them will be randomly selected to get a pilot UBI program, and the other half won't. Check back in X amount of time. Do that for all sorts of ideas. The confounding variable is *having a polity that votes to be a part of the policy change experiment;* it still could provide useful data, I think.

This is pretty stunning. We are talking about a mainstream analyst on a mainstream network (MSNBC) saying the government of a free liberal democracy should use its power to make it illegal for a network with views and opinions he doesn't like to exist. Let's get this out of the way first: I think Fox News is incontrovertibly a pernicious force which distorts our discourse and makes reasonable dialogue more difficult than it would otherwise be. 

I have similarly sentiments towards numerous Reddit subs on both the Right and the Left, numerous podcasts on the Right and the Left, numerous books and magazines on both the Right and the Left and surely you all do as well! Like me, you probably think the subs, podcasts, books, and magazines of the Right are, on net, worse than those of the Left. But people on the Right of course hold the precise opposite view. If a Biden administration were to go after Fox, how long would it be before the next Republican administration attacked the speech of MSNBC? 

I sentence Giridharadas to remedial political theory course where he must read Voltaire, Mill , Jefferson and and actually reflect on the type of world that would exist if governments were given the power to systematically censor speech that the powers that be at any given moment didn't like.

Thank god they went to Comet Ping Pong instead. Near miss.

The good news is that we will be able to lure in enough virgins to sacrifice on time. I’m going to catch mine on 4chan. Remember, you get 500 Soros-bucks for each one you bring in. 

Also, thankfully I’ve managed to put in the 5G microchips back into the vaccine supply. That’s why we need the “second dose.” That dastardly Trump tried to get away with removing them, but thankfully his efforts have failed.

Shout out to the Wuhan Virology Lab too. Without their work, this year would not have been possible. It's inspiring to see so much work pay off so well. 

I’m delighted to announce the Antifa actors we got for the False Flag on the Capitol building were successful beyond our wildest dreams! Without them, Trump would surely have gotten the proof of our rigging the Dominion machines out. The Q-Anon Shamen gets a huge shout out. His years of studying at the Yale School of Drama paid off, and he’ll be rewarded with a few lead Hollywood roles and any child of his choosing. 

Finally, I want to say that with Q gone, our plans to reduce testosterone through mass fluoridation are on schedule. The preliminary studies with frogs have surpassed our wildest expectations. 2021 is looking good!

Now not only have they knocked the proposed stimulus down to $1400 with the excuse that “well what we meant was $1400 which if u add the $600 you already got it’s basically $2000 teehee”. 

Now that’s not in any way what they were saying during the senate races but even if you give them that, reports are now saying the stimulus could come out as late as at least March or even April, and Biden’s NOT gonna do budget reconciliation to get it though with the Dems’ majority. 

Like if you’re not gonna do the option that would take longer anyway and you’re gonna try to get the republican votes why wouldn’t you put the bill on the floor right away?

OBLIGATORY VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY INFO:

Volodymyr Zelensky became president of Ukraine in 2019 when he won the presidential election with 73% of the vote, running for the Servant of the People Party, beating out incumbent Petro Poroshenko. Servant of the People Party, named after the television show, is a centrist party which believes in populism, direct democracy, anti-corruption and pro-Europeanism. Much of his proposals for reform have been met with resistance by the Ukrainian parliament, including electoral reform, dismissing the Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense and head of the SBU, reintroducing criminal liability for illegal enrichment, and removing immunity from lawmakers, diplomats and judges. He has managed to dismiss the heads of 15 oblasts and 5 SBU oblast heads. In terms of policy he is a supporter of Ukraine joining NATO and the EU, though wants the people to vote directly on it and promises to facilitate the vote in 2024. He has stated that Crimea can only be returned when Russia has a regime change. Zelensky is a supporter of medical cannabis, abortion, and the legalisation of prostitution and gambling. Additionally, he supports the decommunization of Ukraine, though does not like its current form, but has come out against de-Russianizing the country. He has labelled Putin as an enemy. In terms of controversies he has been repeatedly accused of abusing power, and was center of attention due to the Trump-Ukraine Scandal.

I wrote this out of the love of my country and the liberal democratic principles of self-governance, so I want to try to argue how the erosion of these ideals here might mean for the future of the liberal world order. **Mostly people's only opinion regarding Taiwan seems to be ""the enemy of my enemy (China) is my friend,""** but the truth about Taiwan's relation with liberalism is, as things always are, complicated.

# Basic facts

Taiwan has two main political parties, the **Kuomintang** (**KMT,** which used to form the one-party authoritarian government before democratic reform) and the **Democratic Progressive Party** (**DPP**, which arose from opposition to the KMT). The DPP is currently in power since 2016.

The thing you need to know is the main ideological difference between the two parties are all organized around an axis of engagement/disengagement with China; any other economic or social issue is secondary. KMT represents the middle class and the older generation which believes economic cooperation with China (such as trade agreements) can help Taiwan economically. \[1\] The DPP has an ultimate goal of independence and sees such engagement as a poison pill that fits with Chinese political ambitions. On a practical level, a small part of either party advocates immediate reunification or declaration of independence (which would result in war), so **the large majority of the electorate prefers the status quo, however unsatisfying it is for either side**.

# Beginning: the one-month seizure of parliament

I’d trace the beginning of Taiwan’s current political climate to [2014 Sunflower Student Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_Student_Movement). At the time, the KMT government was about to agree to a trade agreement on the service industry with China, despite majority opposition. In hindsight, such opposition is based on a mixture of the distrust of the competence of the admin, suspicion of the CCP but also part of a global backlash against free trade. **The student activists, cheered on but not directed by the DPP, rushed our parliament building and prevented our legislature from convening for a month.** The speaker of our legislature, who had a reputation of bipartisanship, refuse to bring in police forces and instead tried to negotiate with both the activists and the opposition party. The result is the trade agreement never passed in the then admin or in the successive ones. The DPP, riding this wave of ""direct democracy,"" swept the electoral votes and came to unified control of government, and many activists who made a name during the movement also found a home as a new generation of politician.

The reason I highlight this event is due to my belief that **the seizure changed the public perception of what is acceptable behavior in the pursuance of (what they believe are) correct policies**. An interesting anecdote is during the heyday of the seizure, the US diplomatic establishment put out an essentially meaningless statement saying they ""support Taiwan's democracy,"" which the student activists and their supporters cheered as a nod to them, when in fact either side (the establishment politicians and the activists) can freely interpret the statement as supportive of them.

# 2016 onwards: The Trumpification of our administration

The thing about Taiwan's diplomacy is **our nation only ever exists as a US policy**. \[3\] If the US one day decide Taiwan need not exist, we will be immediate annihilated; our people have essentially no say. Therefore, US relation is the single most important aspect of our foreign policies our government must manage \[4\], and for the decades our nation has been in existence the government has always pursued a bipartisan relationship with successive US admins.

This all changed in the Trump years, **when our government both officially and unofficially supported Trump all the way leading up to the 2020 election.** The reasoning is mostly due to Trump's combative rhetoric towards China turned out to be very beneficial to DPP's electoral politics; the party went from losing big in the 2018 midterm to winning big in the 2020 presidential election \[4\]  [One executive committee member wore a Trump mask](https://udn.com/news/story/6656/4988586) to a party conference, friendly media personalities all educate the public on how Trump's reelection is good for Taiwan, and our MSM even unchangingly [repeated all the ""stolen election"" lies](https://www.setn.com/News.aspx?NewsID=860008) especially during the initial red mirage. There are even news of couples requiring counseling because one is too much into the cult of Trump (which is ridiculous when you think about it, involving another country's election results).

# Embrace of Trumpism, fake news &amp; silencing dissents

Taiwan's embrace of Trumpism is more than aesthetics, in the last few years there are worrying signs that our government has taken the lessons of Trump to heart:

* [**The Education Ministry refused to appoint the new president of the National Taiwan University as selected by the committee despite no legal authority.**](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190104121611177) Of course extraneous charges were made up after the refusal, even though none justified the holding up the appointment instead of conducting investigations after being sworn in. \[4\] The main reason (as far as anyone can tell) seem to be an error in some Survivor-style vote-fixing resulting in the selection process so the candidate preferred by the government did not prevail. Even though the refusal to appoint is blatantly illegal, as Trump discovered there is very little you can do when the you as the government ignored the law and working through the slow legal process (like his tax returns) often means you de facto win. This is one of the factors in the disastrous 2018 local elections results for the DPP, afterwards the government caved and appointed the president.
* [**They forced a pro-KMT/pro-China cable network off-air**](https://thediplomat.com/2020/12/pro-china-tv-station-goes-off-air-in-taiwan-after-losing-broadcast-license/) (now they stream online via YouTube). Now I'm not exactly a fan of the network, in fact there are reasonable doubt (but no clear evidence) of how the network is supported by CCP funds or at least has Chinese influence. But saying you support freedom of expression means very little when people are saying stuff you don't object to, it's only in the edge cases when you are truly tested in your conviction. What's worrying here is the double standard; another [TV network executive actually has his own faction within the DPP executive committee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/湧言文化基金會), but such direct involvement of both electoral politics and the media was never challenged or even examined.
* [**They prosecuted a medical doctor with a new law against ""spreading rumors"" affecting public health carrying penalties of up to 3 years imprisonment**](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/人物-從社運青年到反萊劑醫師-蘇偉碩-我當官的話說不定比他們更醜惡-013156755.html), because he opposes government efforts to allow import of US pork containing a chemical substance not currently permitted. This is particularly ironic since the doctor was a friend and ""ally"" of the DPP when the party was in opposition and the KMT government was the one trying to import chemical infused US beef.

The only reason all this blatant intimidation of dissent did not result in much humanitarian crises is due to our legal system largely being independent from political actions, with the judges often handing down lenient or outright dismissing the charges despite the strict wording of the laws. But it's clear that **the knowledge you can get into legal trouble merely by reposting news unflattering to the admin means self-censorship is real** in online spaces, which is what the government is really after.

# The youths cheering on illiberalism &amp; Trump

You might reasonably ask, if there are actually signs of democracy backsliding, why are there basically not report of them? Well, apart from the foreign media most focusing on illiberal acts that actually affect the international community (Poland and Hungary vs non-EU Eastern European countries), the fact is the Internet skews the young and online, and **the younger generation of Taiwan widely support governmental acts that they believe are correct and just, liberal principles be damned**. Like I said, the fact most people celebrate the closure of a TV network they disagree with, even if for the sake of argument accepting that they deserve to be closed, shows an electorate that did not care for liberal principles at all. Same with the embrace of Trump; even presupposing the wisdom in entrusting one's destiny to *Trump* and accepting him to be the savior to those oppressed by the CCP, to be a ""democracy activist"" then having zero internal struggle in embracing all elements of Trumpism shows that you don't truly hold liberal democratic values in heart.

Which brings me back to my final point, what's the future of the liberal world order? What I observe in our Asian democracies is, when upon a time where the US and its model of liberal democracy is the world's only superpower, many countries even with people without deep understanding of liberalism can easily embrace such a model. But along with the rise of China and the US's own betrayal of such principles, **those liberal democracies whose form of government was foisted upon by foreign powers rather than fought for by the people are shown to be easily regressible.** And even though I focused on Taiwan's issues here, the fact is [Hong Kong's ""democracy activists"" also loved Trump](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/10/democracy-activists-who-love-trump/616891/), and South Korea's ""progressive"" president is also charged with [suspending a prosecutor when he's digging to close to the admin's own people](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Moon-takes-heat-for-suspending-South-Korea-s-top-prosecutor). Japan under the last long-serving PM Abe also sees worrying patterns of suppressing information and intimidating adverse press.

# The backsliding Asian democracies &amp; the future of liberalism

In the end, of course, Trumpism did not prevail. Right now, it does *not* seem like Biden is softening the US stance against Trump or altering its commitments to Taiwan, \[6\] but one does wonder if the future US comes to be an unreliable ally to liberal democracies worldwide, what will it mean for the potentially regressing regimes like ours. Does Biden symbolize a new decade of a more assertive form of liberal democracy, or is he a last gasp of what the end of history was supposed to be? I'll leave with the same Eliot poem EU Commission President von der Leyen quoted at the end of Brexit negotiations:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we call the beginning is often the end  
&gt;  
&gt;And to make an end is to make a beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

*Footnotes*

\[1\] Yes, you might note the irony that the KMT during the authoritarian years are the one most antagonistic to the CCP is nowadays advocating for close economic and possibly political integration. Which is not dissimilar to how the slave-freeing Republicans becoming the party of White grievances over the years.

\[2\] This is a contentious topic along Taiwanese political lines so I'll try to be fair, but of course you should try to look for original material if you have questions.

\[3\] A short history in case you want to know: the CCP after taking over the mainland was entirely ready to annihilate our Nationalist government which evacuated to Taiwan, but due to the outbreak of the Korean War, the US saw it as of strategic importance to prevent China from overtaking Taiwan, thus sending military intervention that saved our island nation.

\[4\] There are other factors such as the opposition KMT nominating a populist candidate that proved unable to unite with the party's more establishment wing, but no one would deny Trump has been very good for business for the DPP.

\[5\] I expect others involved in Taiwanese politics to strenuously object to the basic facts I gave, since this event had been highly polarized around partisan lines. But just as Trump's acts are reported completely differently by people of different political affiliations in the US, you can understand how even objective facts can be endless litigated nowadays. Regardless of what set of facts you accept, rest assured this is one of the main reason perceptions around the government soured during the following local election.

\[6\] I'd like to note that, if the situation is reversed and Trump won despite Taiwan's blatant public support of Biden, there is no way Trump would not try to punish Taiwan even though Taiwan's support had no meaningful impact. Sounds like a smarter diplomatic strategy to stick to non-partisan engagement like always, but if they were thinking about party politics...",1,0.084,0.79,0.127,0.9988

167,"My response and criticism to ""Taiwan's embrace of Trumpism"" First of all, I am a DPP supporter and member. I support Biden early in the last year once he won the Dem primary. After I read [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/l4p7of) early in the morning, I kinda agree with what she/he said in that post, but I would like to have some brief responses even arguments with some of that post.

#1. Our government, including President Tsai herself, did not officially endorse Trump or GOP.

Our ambassador Hsiao Bi-Khim have spoken with Secretary Blinken as once Biden got elected (The high level members of DPP are in good relationship with Kurt Campbell and him). We have official permission to attend Biden's inauguration for the first time of any POTUS inauguration since 1979. We congratulated Biden as he got elected despite the supporters went crazy nuts on ""STOP THE STEAL"" conspiracy.

But I agree with the argument that 三立, Apple Daily and other pan-Green media went crazy batshit on Steve Bannon, Falun Gong's BS and that New York Post shenanigans on Bidens, as well as pan-Green supporters have wrong impression and interpretation on Democrats.

but it does not mean that DPP is fully supporting Trump or backing Trumpism at all. Sure Taiwan is historically pro-GOP thanks to President Ike (he gave Taiwan a huge support to fight against Mao's aggression), but like [this](https://newtalk.tw/news/view/2020-08-21/454006), as some party wants to hold a Trump supporting conference, some of our high level members in the Presidential Palace disagree with that decision. And the Trump supporting protests in Taiwan doesn't have any connection with DPP or President Tsai.

#2. The meaning of Sunflower movement

While President Ma Ying-Jeou was in charge and Kuomintang was the ruling party, having the most seats in the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan had become more and more close to China economically, socially and culturally. 

Since he signed ECFA (Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement), Taiwan has closed ties with China years and years. Although I support any kinds of free trade, yet China as you know, hasn't obey any rules or principles of international trade regulations as being IP theft or starting a technological war, even as their debt trap — Belt &amp; Road Initiative.

Not to mention that China has corroded Hong Kong from a thriving economy and democracy, to an authoritarian, Orwell-esque shithole since they have broken the promise of ""One Country, Two System"" by passing the national security law, and fully manipulated by CCP economically since passing CEPA (Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement).

Back in 2014, if President Ma passed service trade agreement with China, our economy would absolutely manipulated by CCP since their huge aggression on Taiwan. Taiwanese would collapsed economically and socially as CCP replace our economic and social freedom which are not easy to come by.

So that's why Sunflower Movement happened. This is not a seizure as simple, and it is totally different with the Capitol riots. This is, our Taiwanese huge resistance on not becoming another Hong Kong or Tibet.

#3. CTi Television (中天) deserved it for being banned from television cables

As u/CorrectHippo said in that post, 

&gt; No country in the world would tolerate propaganda of foreign annexation or a of a foreign rival on any form of media. If this is supposed to be the standard for freedom of speech, no country has freedom of speech.

Since CTi and China Television, along with China Times, one of the major newspapers in Taiwan, purchased by Want Want Food chairman Tsai Eng-Meng (蔡衍明), who has massive economic benefits in China, all of them become worse and worse when it comes to quality or objectively. Sadly, [they have been massive propaganda machines in favor of the CCP for a long time](https://opinion.cw.com.tw/blog/profile/390/article/7840). Not only the staff must listen to their owner Tsai's beliefs and orders which has presumably connect with 國台辦, but the whole CTi Television has become an low-effort entertainment show since it is notorious on [spreading Han Kuo-Yu (韓國瑜) frantic apotheosis](https://www.fountmedia.io/article/81098)and lots of misinformation, even [violated the law several times since 2014](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%A9%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E5%8F%B0%E4%B8%8D%E7%8D%B2%E7%BA%8C%E7%89%8C%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6).（[Another proof](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E5%B9%B4%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%A9%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E5%8F%B0%E7%88%AD%E8%AD%B0%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6#2019%E5%B9%B4%E5%9C%8B%E5%AE%B6%E9%80%9A%E8%A8%8A%E5%82%B3%E6%92%AD%E5%A7%94%E5%93%A1%E6%9C%83%E5%B0%8D%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%A9%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E5%8F%B0%E7%9A%84%E8%A3%81%E7%BD%B0%E6%A1%88%E7%B4%80%E9%8C%84))

Imagine if you were West German in 1950's, you will not support or tolerate any of pro-USSR/pro-East Germany rhetoric on any media in West Germany, amirite?

#4. The medical doctor, 蘇偉碩, is actually spreading misinformation on the US porks and ractopamine

I respect Dr. Su as a psychiatrist and his hard efforts on opposing ractopamine. But he should not spread false information on the US porks or ractopamine itself.

Most of the US porks, in fact doesn't have ractopamine. Instead, merely 20% has ractopamine. And the content is measured up to standard usually. As [I asked in r/AskAnAmerican last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/kjr6k9/), ractopamine has almost none impacts on eating American pork as an American. The main reason why opposing it, is trade protectionism.

And the double-standard truly comes out when KMT lifted the ban on the US beef containing ractopamine.

They neglected any of international regulations on food safety, and do not label any Taiwanese meat products as  ""Local Produce"" whereas DPP government did (台灣豬標章).

So that's why we Taiwanese can easily bought the US imported beef products in Costco of Taiwan despite 70-80% of them containing ractopamine.

Also, Dr. Su considered that [ractopamine is 250 times poisonous than MDMA which is totally false and no evidence](https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202012180015). MDMA is not a poisonous drug since [it has been tested for PTSD psychotherapy](https://maps.org/research/mdma/ptsd/veterans)years ago. Apparently Dr. Su falsely spreads the propaganda and that's the main reason why he is fined and punished.

#5. Kuan Chung Ming (管中閔)'s legitimacy on being elected as the new president of NTU

The major conflicts on the process of electing Dr. Kuan are as below,

(1) The Selection Committee of NTU has several of his Taiwan Mobile (台灣大哥大) colleagues. One of them is the deputy chairman and the other is the independent director of TWM, Inc., which is violating the principle of interesting avoidance.

(2) Dr. Kuan is illegally holding two or more part-time jobs even teaching in China. He should not write columns of any media when he was a public servant.

Other details are [here](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E5%B9%B4%E5%9C%8B%E7%AB%8B%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E6%A0%A1%E9%95%B7%E9%81%B4%E9%81%B8%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6 )(in Chinese)

The factors of DPP lost in 2018 are complicated. One of them which is the most obvious, is [the cyberwarfare from China as Han Kuo-Yu got boosted by Chinese propaganda](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/26/chinese-cyber-operatives-boosted-taiwans-insurgent-candidate/). It is too arbitrary that disapproval of appointing Dr. Kuan is one of the main factors of losing the election in 2018.

#Conclusion: Taiwan is still the most liberal country as its people in the whole Asia

We have the best healthcare system as anyone can easily go to the doctor with relatively low insurance costs compared with other countries. Our LGBT rights are regarded as the best in whole Asia as we have same-sex marriage and recognitions as well as served in the military openly. Our freedom is the best in Asia so that we have movies talking about LGBT (Your Name Engraved Herein) or White Terror (Detention, A City of Sadness). Our freedom rhetoric gave platforms of visionary and outstanding movie directors like Ang-Lee, Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao-Hsien which are pioneers of Taiwanese Cinema and leaving some markable impacts on history of cinema.

This is why China is not comparable with Taiwan when it comes to human rights, LGBT rights and freedom. I hope that both the US and Taiwan maintain a good relationship and Taiwan can participate more on liberal world affairs.

# 1660: The English East India Company

Let's go back to the year 1660. The [English East India Company](https://web.archive.org/web/20140330215843/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/trading/booksgifts1.html) has recently become a major economic power trading spices and other commodities between the British Isles and the East-Indies. The EIC became a world superpower ultimately accounting for nearly [half the worlds trade](https://books.google.com/books?id=6g5XwAEACAAJ). Along with the spices, the EIC brought what started out as a novelty item: cheap colorful [calico cloths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico) from southwestern India. These cheap colorful cloths became an instant success in England, which would come to dominate the spice trade by the mid to late 1700s. 

# 1700: The Calico Acts 

Desperate to protect their wool industry, Britain moved swiftly to prop up the wool industry. By 1685, Britain imposed a [10% tariff on the imports of East Indian](http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/early-british-industrial-revolution-and.html) goods. The demand for calico textiles remained high however, threatening the wool industry. By 1690, Britain doubled its tariff [on these imports to 20%](http://socialdemocracy21stcentury.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/early-british-industrial-revolution-and.html). However, sales of the calico prints were still on the rise. The [soft, cheap, colorful calico textiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico) were far superior to the sturdy [British Worsted textiles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worsted)  

However, the British wool industry still struggled to compete with the cheap calico prints. In an attempt to stifle competition, in [1700 Britain banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Acts) the trade of printed or colored calico prints. However, this merely shifted the demand to [grey cloth instead](https://archive.org/stream/lancashireworthi00espi#page/322/mode/2up) of colored prints. The wool industry simply could not compete with the superior calico prints. By 1707, Britain increased their tariffs to 50%. 

# 1721: Britain Bans the Sale of Cotton Textiles

 Struggling to compete with the calico prints, by 1721 Britain outright [banned the sale of most cotton textiles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Acts) 

[As typical of other protectionist policies,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism#History) the Calico Acts harmed the British consumers by raising the price and reducing the quality of textiles. To make matters worse, exports of British wool became nearly non-existent. Since other nations preferred the cheaper, finer calico textiles, [exports of British Worsted textiles fell through the floor](https://archive.org/details/wooltextileindus0000unse/page/26). 

Even today we hear echoes of this. Remember just last week when [we made fun of British Fishermen for losing their jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/l3u7k4/sorry_but_it_is/) after voting for Brexit? When you don't have to compete with superior products on a global market, you can expect the quality of your product to fall, all while consumers bear the brunt of increased costs.  

# 1730: Britain exempts British Cotton Fabrics

Facing fierce criticism of [rising costs from consumers](https://archive.org/details/wooltextileindus0000unse/page/26), Britain begun to backtrack its protections for the wool industry. Acknowledging the superiority of cotton textiles over wool, Britain exempts the sale of British cotton textiles to help [lower costs and meet the demands](http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf) for cheaper fabrics. Over the next few decades, the cotton textile industry out-grew the wool industry. However, exports remained minimal as the British textiles were seen as inferior to the calico prints. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 1774: The Calico Acts are Repealed

[The repeal of the Calico Act in 1774, was, without doubt, one of the most pivotal and important decisions taken during the Industrial Revolution.](https://intriguing-history.com/3092/) As Britain repealed the Calico Acts, the British cotton industry realized it had to compete against the cheaper, albeit labor intensive cotton production from the east. The global competition spurred investment into the British cotton textile industry, pushing them to use [industrial equipment (notably the Spinning Mule) in order to make textiles cheaper than their calico counterparts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution#Invention_of_textile_machinery) As many of us here know, textiles were the dominant industry in the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Facing global competition pushed Britain to industrialize, marking a major turning point in history. 

&amp;#x200B;

204,"Dear Representative Valadao, you should drop the GOP.  I think most American's agree that our current form of government has major levels of dysfunction in it.  The two part system exacerbates the issue, and has ground our legislative branch to a standstill. I feel like a potential upside of Trumps legacy is there is an opportunity to fracture the current two party institution. The house of representatives has people in both party who do not really agree with leadership of their party. I know a its a long shot, but there are potential targets on both sides of the aisle that could potentially start a cascading effect of independent legislators. 

Dear Representative Valadao,

Thank you for voting to impeach President Trump on January 13, 2021. It shows that you are a man of dignity and Integrity. You understand the responsibility your position gives you and take your job of representing the people of the 21st district of California seriously. After losing your reelection in 2018 you still desired to represent your district and the people of California. That persistence was rewarded, and you were reelected in a district that also ended up voting for President Biden over President Trump. This discrepancy in voting is because the people in your district trust you to do the right thing. They placed their wellbeing in your hands, and hope you legislate what is best for CA 21. Unfortunately, many of your Republican colleagues do not share the same fortitude that you possess. But you do not have to be saddled with the GOP and the legacy of Trump. To help persevere the legacy, function, and power of the Legislative Branch, you should leave the Republican Party and become an independent. 

I understand that the two-party system is heavily entrenched, and breaking from it could doom your political career, but the people of CA 21 did not elect you to become a career politician. They elected you to help legislate change that will benefit their lives. Your district is unique. It is the breadbasket of America, producing over 200 different crops. Over 70% of the district is Hispanic, with a quarter of the population being born abroad. The people in your district care about issues that are not popular with the broader GOP coalition. Fair and open immigration policies, better access to healthcare, increased education standards, etc. Unfortunately, you are often forced into tough voting situations. You either must tow the GOP line, and vote for laws that would further disenfranchise your communities, or vote against the party, like you did with the Dream act, and face the ire of party leadership. 

Luckily, you do not have to be stuck in this dilemma. The people of the Central Valley trust you. They know that first and foremost you are a dairy farmer that will try to help your agricultural community the best you can. Separating from the GOP would not hinder your legislative ability, but greatly increase it. Our house has become too divided over the last few decades, and strong independent leadership is the way forward. The two-party system has twisted the legislative branch into an unrecognizable mess from what the founders had envisioned. Washington specifically warned us from partisan infighting yet look at the spectacle our government has become. We need a return to thought out policy that is carried out by a functioning government. You could be the start of something great, a shift to representatives forming coalitions representing the needs of there communities, not the needs of part leadership. 

On January 13, 2021 you showed the world that you were a man of integrity. You have the opportunity to start a powerful movement. Representatives on both sides are the black sheep of their parties. But as independent actors you could force real change in how our government functions. Help return the peoples faith in governance as your forge your own path free from the GOP.",1,0.054,0.749,0.197,0.9989

\&gt;effective 40% estate tax  
\&gt;unemployment benefits available if you quit  
\&gt;housing and food stamp benefits (on top of unemployment) amounting to $150-200 billion a year  
\&gt;fully refundable child tax credit

\&gt;Unemployment benefits that pay $1000 a week for a $1000 a week salary on average (roughly 2x what European counterparts pay for the same salary) and last for 2x the time of the most generous Western European systems  


AFAIK Germany, Austria and Switzerland are much more conservative on welfare (have proven this before, switzerland is virtually ancap and housing benefits are asset tested in all of these unlike the US where section 8 is NOT ASSET TESTED), the US health system is already much more progressive (medicaid is literally free - poor people in DACH etc pay for it via payroll tax),   


Corporate income taxes will be BETTER in DACH.   


Capital gains taxes are BETTER in DACH (0% in CH, \~25% in DE/AT)   


So could biden end up unironically shifting all investment into Europe? Should these European companies start offering ancestral visas to German Americans to come back to help their birth rates?  


This seems like an ideal time for Europe's ordoliberalism to outshine an America that is becoming increasingly social democratic! And the Social Security Payroll tax exclusion is going to hike income taxes even higher!

1. **Both of Biden's least improved and most improved demographics are related to age and race.** Biden did relatively worse with 30-44 African Americans by 33%. Likewise, he relatively improved the most with 45-64 aged Latinos by 24%. Tangentially related, it seems that Obama in 2008 did mediocre with Latinos, as there was no relative change between Biden's and Obama's performance with them. I guess this shows with Biden's losses in Miami-Dade and RGV (Obama only won Miami-Dade by 17) canceling out with his improvements in Arizona/SoCal, and no net change in cities like Chicago or NYC.
2. **Biden did very well with Catholics (compared to 2012 and 2016)**. This should come as no surprise.
3. **Biden did very well with the middle class.** He relatively improved with incomes ranging from 50k to 100k by 17%. This should also come as no surprise because he only mentioned three things in a sentence: A noun, a verb, and the middle class. While it is age-related, he also did very well with 40-49 aged folks, improving among them by 13%. Likewise, despite the rhetoric portrayed by populists that the democrats are becoming the party of the elite, Biden actually did worse among ""elites"" (incomes ranging from 100k+) by double digits compared to Obama in 2008 and Hillary in 2016.
4. **Right-wing populism still doesn't play well with swingy folks**. Biden improved with moderates by 12 and with independents by 8, and considering the fact that you need to do well will these demographics in order to win as a Republican, it's a good sign that it was rejected by these groups.
5. **The partisan divide grows**. Biden did the best with liberals and democrats among the four democratic candidates, and Trump did the best with conservatives and republicans among the four Republican candidates",1,0.079,0.83,0.091,0.8052

### Introduction
Took me long enough to get to this one, didn't it? Why would I leave you guys hanging for the next installment despite the fact that I spaced the posts about the House out by days not weeks? Well, in part things are more complicated in the Senate than in the House. Also, I have a day job, might have mentioned it before.

Anyway, in my last post I said the next post I'd write would be about Committees. That's twice I've lied now. 

### The Fortress of Friendship (I'm not kidding)

Despite being named after Sheev Palpatine, the United States Senate isn't a force-attuned body. Quite the opposite in fact, the entire purpose of the Framers in giving Senators six-year terms with a staggered cycle of replacement (one third of the chamber is up for reelection every two years) is to make sure that the institution is pretty insulated from the political forces that dominate the country at any given time. Sounds counterintuitive to our ideals in this country, right? Why would we want part of our Government to be less susceptible to popular forces? Well, let's remember how many seats the Tea Party Congressmen won in the House, and how many they won in the Senate. Same thing goes for the Qultists, they might find *support* in the Senate, but they don't win seats in here.

Taken to it's logical conclusion, this is just one part of the reason the Senate is so different from the House. If the President and everybody in the House changes in a single election (which technically *could* happen), then two-thirds of the Senators of this country would still be the same people they were in the last Congress. Even if leadership switches hands, the fact that it's those same guys in there mean that things that go beyond the rules and operating procedures of the body can stick around for a long time. Friendships and rivalries among Senators (which are surprisingly critical to the work that happens in the Chamber) are forged across years of working with people, calling them every morning, eating lunch with them in the afternoon, and staying up with them on the floor at 3am because there was unfinished business to attend to.

Honest to God, everyone recommends you read Gold's *Senate Procedure and Practice* or *Riddick's Rules* (which are great resources, I won't downplay that), but if you really want to understand the Senate you need to buy Al Franken's book. There's 100 Senators, they all know each other. There isn't a fake cordial coworker attitude like you have in a big company when you're in the office break room. These people are usually *actual* friends, and that makes an insane difference.

How? Imagine I'm a Legislative Assistant (I have dreams too, you bastards) who's working in the House and my Member of Congress is really interested in getting some bill onto the Floor. We write everything up with the help of the kind folks at CRS and maybe some committee staff if we have that kind of access, and then the first thing we do is shop it around Caucuses to try and get some cosponsors. We don't know who's going to be interested in our bill, but maybe we know some Caucuses that focus on these issues so if we bring it up to the Caucus chair then we'll get some other Representatives who are interested in working with us. 

In the Senate it isn't necessary to go to the Caucuses and treat them like bulletin boards. If we're shopping a bill around then my Senator will probably say ""Oh you know who loves this stuff? Inhofe. I'll call him when I'm in my hideaway later and see if he wants to move forward with a letter, you should reach out to Heinrich and Reed's people, and I think I can talk to Schatz when we get lunch later to see what he thinks about all of this."" Just like that we informed 1/25th of the Chamber, and the Chair and Ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, about what we were doing, and we probably just got them all to cosponsor our bill.

Friendship. Turns out, it's not just something made up by George Lucas for Return of the Jedi, it's existed since 1787 at the least and it's a vital part of running this country.

Drag this out, and coalitions of friendships emerge. When describing the majority in the Senate, there's the standard definition of whichever caucus leads the Chamber, but also the simpler definition of ""whoever the hell is on the big side of any given argument."" Party leaderships negotiate things based on the priorities and personalities of individuals, often speaking with individual Senators who aren't a part of their caucus directly. For what it's worth, this is why I appreciate working in the Senate so much. In the House, the Majority Leadership are some of this country's rulers. In the Senate, every individual Senator is one of this country's rulers.


### The Basics of Legislation

Paradoxically, despite having fewer rules than the House that govern behavior on the floor (to foster flexible debate and negotiation), the Senate is more complicated than the House could ever fucking wish to be.

It isn't really a paradox, fewer rules means things are less structured, and the less structure there is the more complicated things can become. I'll try and give you a basic overview of what happens in the Chamber but it's dynamic so you really should take some time to go through other sources. *Senate Procedure and Practice* by Martin Gold is a classic, *Riddick's Rules of Procedure* is a classic, Al Franken's book is surprisingly useful at times, and *Inside Congress* taught me everything I knew when I was a humble Staff Assistant still trying to figure out what the lights on the clock meant (instead of just giving up and checking Webster because it's not 1962 anymore). Also, check rules.senate.gov. Great place to look things up.

Unlike in the House where the rules and their determination are critical to understanding how most legislation will move through the chamber, in the Senate the rules don't apply to most bills that pass. Guidelines of debate that are hallmarks of the House get thrown out the window on the North side of the Capitol. So how do things actually pass?

Three words, two categories, say them, and you'll move a bill through the Senate. ""Unanimous Consent"" and ""Cloture.""

We talked about **Unanimous Consent** in the House before but in the Senate it's a bit different. On the House side, the Majority and Minority Leadership agree to terms of debate for a certain bill that will allow it to move through the chamber in a 435-0 vote. On the Senate side, to the best of my knowledge anybody can propose that a bill move through the chamber with unanimous consent, and if it does then the measure actually doesn't even make it to the floor at all. Functionally, if you're trying to pass a bill through unanimous consent, you do all the heavy lifting beforehand in basically any medium you can think of: you convince other Senators to go your way when you're eating lunch in the Dining room or when you're taking the train from the Capitol to Hart, and by the time you're actually voting you already know how everything is going to go.

The bills that are considered this way aren't even voted on on the Floor of the Senate anymore, it's all digital. There's a hotline that all the members can access, I'm pretty sure they get most of their access through their emails, and they have this conference call twice a week I think to actually do the votes. It's fun living in the future isn't it, James Monroe could never.

**Cloture** isn't actually a mechanism of debate either, quite the opposite, it's a mechanism to shut debate down. If 3 out of every 5 Senators says ""Yeah, I've had enough of this shit, can we *please* move on?"" then any further debate on the measure that people are tired of needs to be concluded within 30 hours of in-session time (which usually adds up to one week in the Chamber depending on the Calendar). Cloture isn't actually a vote on the measure in debate either. Given today's numbers of 100 Senators (which I hope might be going up soon), if 60 Senators vote for cloture but only 52 Senators vote Yea on a measure, the measure still passes. 

Naturally, Cloture is a counter to the filibuster (which I'll talk about in a bit), but it's also a counter to regular prolonged debate that was rampant in the early Republic, and still exists to this day. The framers wanted the Senate to be a place where *actual* negotiation could happen on the Floor. In Jefferson's mind, Senators would receive a proposition from the House, and if two of them disagreed then they could talk it out right there and maybe bring their opponent to their side instead of falling back blindly on their constituents' opinions.

It'd go something like this: 

&gt;""Senator u/Luchofromvenezuela , this proposition is absolutely preposterous. Placing u/FireDistinguishers ' stories from inside the Chamber into the main text of the prezpoll Senator opinion posts will distract our users from rating these Senators on merit of their political positions and work history. It would make the posts into a simple personality contest.""

&gt;""But Senator u/JaceFlores , the posts are already colored by those stories. A person must merely scroll down to see them, at which point he or she will immediately scroll back to the link and vote on their ranking. Look at how u/FireDistinguishers inflated Chris Van Hollen's ranking by consistently praising him week after week until we finally voted on him. Besides that, the poll is quite the personality contest already, look no further than Senator Collins' rank to see such a thing.""

&gt;""I understand your point Senator, but you must remember that while a person's opinions may be influenced by these factors, endorsing these factors would be a waving sign that formulating your thoughts on these Senators should indeed be based on personality. While I can accept that some users already do so, I cannot insinuate that such a thing is right.""

&gt;""You make an excellent point Senator, I concede.""

Now, what if that went on for six days? Well some rules of the Senate have been formulated for exactly that kind of behavior to go on *while* the Chamber attends to other business, but before those days if you were just tired of hearing some guys talking about something that should've been resolved already, then you and 59 of your buddies could officially tell those guys to shut the hell up so everyone can get back to work. 59 being modular of course, could be more in the future, definitely was less in the 1820s, it's just 3 out of 5.

Most measures in the Senate pass with Unanimous Consent. Think about that. Think about what kind of bills would have every single Senator voting ""Yea"" on them. This fact alone changes basically everything about how bills are handled in the Senate, they have to be drafted carefully, negotiated carefully, there need to be incentives for people to vote for things they wouldn't normally vote for. Mostly, that takes the form of IOUs, ""If you vote for this bill you don't like, I'll vote for one of your bills I don't like."" These kinds of bills can often times be built into packages of bills, and every office knows that these are a great way to get more contentious laws passed. If something is extremely contentious, language might be plucked from one bill and placed in another one to sweeten it up. The NDAA is a great example of this, because it has to pass every year.

There's a phrase that an LA told me once, ""In the House your job is to pass a bill, but over here your job is to pass language."" Does that mean nobody cares if bills pass? Absolutely not, it's just not my job, it's my Member's job. They have everyone in their contact list and they have every chance to see the other 99 people who vote alongside them. Senators pass laws, Senate staff pass language.

### Presiding 

Now, ok, technically the Vice President is the Presiding Officer of the Senate in the same way that the Speaker of the House is the Presiding Officer of the House, but the Vice President has a ton of things to do, so they can be pretty hands-off. That depends on the person and on the circumstances of any particular Congress as well. Vice President Harris will be in the Capitol a lot because of the 50-50 split. Vice President Pence showed up from time to time to serve as a liaison between the Executive and Legislative branches and maybe make deals, but he wasn't there a ton. Vice President Biden loved the Senate, so he'd be around more than was necessarily required of him because he knew he could serve President Obama's agenda pretty well from the Capitol. Vice President Cheney was too busy being the President to be the Vice President. It really all depends.

When the Vice President isn't around, the Presiding Officer is the President Pro Tempore, a role automatically given to the most senior member of the majority since the late 1800s. Most of the time, the President Pro Temore doesn't want to preside over the Senate because he or she has other shit to do, so the presiding chair is usually filled with somebody else from the majority party (more often than not, younger members, I can't wait to see Ossoff presiding).

I know what you're thinking. ""Wait, they just let anybody from the majority party preside? But the Speaker of the House is such a powerful position, but over here they just give it to whoever the hell they can find??"" Yeah, basically. Since things are looser in the Senate, the role of the Presiding Officer is more limited. It's still powerful, and an incredible way for anyone who's sitting in the chair to actually learn the realities of the Senate floor and parliamentary procedure, but from a tactial perspective the only reason you need someone there is to make sure that there's a member of the majority party present and softly leading the Chamber at all times when the Senate is in session. High ranking Senators, senior Senators, Senators with considerably important Committee assignments can't do that shit, they have other fucking places to be while the floor is still open in debate. A kid who just won their first term though? Someone who still really needs to learn the rules? Put them in charge as a way to force them to study, and you can go about your business while they watch things and make sure nothing falls apart. It's like having a 14 year-old babysit a 5 year-old. The parent just need to go to the store really quickly and buy batteries for the TV remote, so you get the teenager to make sure their baby sister doesn't break anything until you can get back. The teenager learns a valuable lesson about how hard it is to keep a child from hurting themself, the child doesn't hurt themself, and the parent can buy the batteries and fix the problem they were having without having to worry about anything. 

### Conclusions
The House is partisan and majoritarian, the Senate is whatever the fuck 100 people who won some elections want it to be. Rules in the House efficiently allow the Chamber to operate and be observed. Rules in the Senate are more like choke points that everybody is forced to contend with as they find a way to actually get work done. Deals are the real MO over here, and combining the rules that we have to play by and the deals that we have to make can really confuse viewers who can't easily track what the hell is happening at any given moment. You look at the House floor and people are in their seats, talking, maybe walking around a little. You look at the Senate floor and everybody's everywhere and nobody knows where to sit and there's paper all over the ground and one desk is full of candy, it's insane. I love it, but it means I'm going to have to take more time explaining what the hell is happening here. I'm not even a third of the way through the Senate, and this is already the longest post I've written. I won't even make a promise about what the next post is about because I don't want to fake you guys out again, but maybe we talk about a certain thing that starts with the letter ""F"" and ends with ""ilibuster.""",1,0.044,0.841,0.115,0.9997

Supporting:
* Fundamentally no part of our political-media ecosystem has changed. The same incentives to radicalize, enrage, and isolate viewers and voters continue to shape our trajectory.
* There is a serious and under-examined contingent of radical far-right thought in our armed forces and police nationally. 
* Republicans won major victories in state houses across the US, promising continued gerrymandering and severe voter suppression efforts
* The republican party has literally shown us the vast majority of representatives stand against democratic values and are fully prepared to take anti-democratic action to undermine our electoral system.
* The 2020 election has shown us hispanics are highly receptive to electoral misinformation, challenging the notion that demographics are destiny and favor democrats long-term
* Key democratic senators (Manchin, Sinema) oppose the filibuster, therefore squashing the possibility of any real democracy reform including addition of new states. This one may be speaking too soon, but we’ll see.

Undermining:
* Twitter and other platforms are taking stronger stances to regulate speech inciting violence and extremism, though not without intense criticism
* The Biden admin and Secretary of Defense Lloyd is pushing to more actively combat far-right radicalization in our armed forces.

&amp;#x200B;

OBLIGATORY ION CHICU INFO:

Ion Chicu became Prime Minister of Moldova in 2019 after former prime minister Maia Sandu was defeated in a vote of no confidence, with 60% of MPs voting to have Mr. Chicu take her place. An independent, his cabinet was also composed of independents, though the parties which supported his cabinet included the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova and the Democratic Party of Moldova, giving his cabinet a left-wing tilt. Most of his premiership had been dedicated to fighting coronavirus, with middling if not poor results as 1 in 16 Moldovians have been infected. Beyond Coronavirus, Chicu had a notable feud with a Romanian MP over Facebook which resulted in Chicu calling Romania the most corrupt country in the world, hurting relations between Romania and Moldova. However, his premiership was cut short by protests demanding earlier parliamentary elections, and he resigned on December 23, 2020, and refused to stay as acting prime minister.

*It’s bad faith in the name of bipartisanship.*

[**Paul Krugman**](https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-krugman) | *February 1, 2021*

So 10 Republican senators are [proposing](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/01/us/biden-administration#a-group-of-centrist-republicans-outlines-their-own-relief-package-ahead-of-a-meeting-with-biden) an economic package that is supposed to be an alternative to President Biden’s [American Rescue Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/). The proposal would reportedly be only a fraction of the size of Biden’s plan and would in important ways cut the heart out of economic relief.

Republicans, however, want Biden to give in to their wishes in the name of bipartisanship. Should he?

No, no, 1.9 trillion times no.

It’s not just that what we know about the G.O.P. proposal indicates that it’s grotesquely inadequate for a nation still ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Beyond that, by their behavior — not just over the past few months but going back a dozen years — Republicans have forfeited any right to play the bipartisanship card, or even to be afforded any presumption of good faith.

Let’s start with the substance.

By any measure, January was the worst pandemic month so far. More than [95,000 Americans ](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;country=~USA&amp;region=World&amp;deathsMetric=true&amp;interval=biweekly&amp;smoothing=0&amp;pickerMetric=total_cases&amp;pickerSort=desc)died of Covid-19; hospitalizations remain [far higher](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-currently-hospitalized) than they were at previous peaks.

True, the end of the nightmare is finally in sight. If all goes well, at some point this year enough people will have been vaccinated that we’ll reach herd immunity, the pandemic will fade away, and normal life can resume. But that’s unlikely to happen before late summer or early fall.

And in the meantime we’re going to have to remain on partial lockdown. It would, for example, be folly to reopen full-scale indoor dining. And the continuing lockdown will impose a lot of financial hardship. Unemployment will remain very high; millions of businesses will struggle to stay afloat; state and local governments, which aren’t allowed to run deficits, will be in [dire fiscal straits](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2020/12/08/staterevenuesummaryduringpandemic.pdf).

What we need, then, is disaster relief to get afflicted Americans through the harsh months ahead. And that’s what the Biden plan would do.

Republicans, however, want to rip the guts out of this plan. They are [seeking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/01/joe-biden-live-updates/#link-C2PBGVS3GBEBVLDQNT7IVBAYMI)to reduce extra aid to the unemployed and, more important, cut that aid off in June — long before we can possibly get back to full employment. They want to [eliminate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-propose-618-billion-covid-relief-plan-11612188851) hundreds of billions in aid to state and local governments. They want to eliminate aid for children. And so on.

This isn’t an offer of compromise; it’s a demand for near-total surrender. And the consequences would be devastating if Democrats were to give in.

But what about bipartisanship? As Biden might say, “C’mon, man.”

First of all, a party doesn’t get to demand bipartisanship when many of its representatives still won’t acknowledge that Biden won legitimately, and even those who eventually acknowledged the Biden victory spent weeks [humoring](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/us/trump-election-lie.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage) baseless claims of a stolen election.

Complaints that it would be “divisive” for Democrats to pass a relief bill on a party-line vote, using reconciliation to bypass the filibuster, are also pretty rich coming from a party that did [exactly that](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-vote-congress.html) in 2017, when it enacted a large tax cut — legislation that, unlike pandemic relief, wasn’t a response to any obvious crisis, but was simply part of a conservative wish list.

Oh, and that tax cut was rammed through in the face of broad public opposition: Only [29 percent](https://news.gallup.com/poll/225137/americans-remain-negative-tax-bill-passage.aspx) of Americans approved of the bill, while 56 percent disapproved. By contrast, the main provisions of the Biden plan are very popular: [79 percent](https://morningconsult.com/2021/01/19/biden-inauguration-economic-priorities-polling/) of the public approve of new stimulus checks, and 69 percent approve of both expanded unemployment benefits and aid to state and local governments. \[*Redditor’s Note: these figures represent the percentage who thought each proposal should be a* top *or* important, but lower ***priority*** *for the Biden administration.*\]

So when one party is trying to pursue policies with overwhelming public support while the other offers lock-step opposition, who, exactly, is being divisive?

Wait, there’s more.

Everyone knew that Republicans, who abruptly stopped caring about deficits when Donald Trump took office, would suddenly rediscover the horror of debt under Joe Biden. What even I didn’t expect was to see them complain that Biden’s plan gives too much help to [relatively affluent families](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ap-top-news-coronavirus-pandemic-bb7f90e28ab160cba510df3b40723fe5).

Again, consider the 2017 tax cut. According to the nonpartisan [Tax Policy Center](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/individual-income-tax-provisions-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-tcja-february-2018/t18-0024), that bill gave 79 percent of its benefits to people making more than $100,000 a year. It gave more to Americans with million-dollar-plus incomes, just 0.4 percent of taxpayers, than the total tax break for those living on less than $75,000 a year, that is, a majority of the population. And now Republicans claim to care about equity?

In short, everything about this Republican counteroffer reeks of bad faith — the same kind of bad faith the G.O.P. displayed in 2009 when it tried to block President Barack Obama’s efforts to rescue the economy after the 2008 financial crisis.

Obama, unfortunately, failed to grasp the nature of his opposition and watered down his policies in a vain attempt to win support across the aisle. This time, it seems as if Democrats [understand](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/us/politics/democrats-agenda-coronavirus-economy.html) what Lucy will do with that football and won’t be fooled again.

So it’s OK for Biden to talk with Republicans and hear them out. But should he make any substantive concessions in an attempt to win them over? Should he let negotiations with Republicans delay the passage of his rescue plan? Absolutely not. Just get it done.",1,0.122,0.741,0.137,0.9296

238,"The case for the TPP #**Background:**

The Trans-Pacific Partnership was a proposed trade agreement between  Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States, with Colombia, Taiwan, The Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka being potential members. It was drafted on the 5th of October 2015 and officially signed on the 4th of February 2016 

[However, on 23rd of January 2017, US President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum to withdraw the United States' signature from the agreement, making its ratification as it was in February 2016 virtually impossible](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-withdrawal-trumps-first-executive-action-monday-sources-say/)






#**Limiting China**

 -If ratified, the TPP would have strengthened American influence on future rules for the global economy. President Obama has argued ""if we don't pass this agreement—if America doesn't write those rules—then countries like China will"" [and it did four years later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership)

-I think that any person should look at China in its current state and say, ""yeah, that's messed up.""

-The way that the  TPP would do this is by importing and relying less on Chinese made goods and instead favoring goods from TPP countries, which would hurt the Chinese economy

-The US and other members of the TPP could then force China to stop with the ongoing Uighur genocide and force it to liberalize its government in exchange for inducting China into the TPP

-This may seem like a pipedream, but even if the TPP is unsuccessful in doing this, I still believe we should import less from genocidal regimes

-[Best thing is, even though the TPP didn’t come into effect, it still forced Chinese leaders to consider domestic economic reforms seriously](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09692290.2020.1801486?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true)


-However, with America's exit from the TPP, Asian countries are now more [dependent](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-death-tpp-the-best-thing-ever-happened-china-19232) on China's economy.


#**General economic benefits**

-[In economics, when there is a tariff on an  import, it results in a deadweight loss.](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chap09-190903083243/95/applicationinternational-trade-34-638.jpg?cb=1580580094) which hurts the average consumer

-[The TPP gets rid of around 18,000 tariffs](https://archive.is/wip/hcnrq), which would result in lower prices on goods for your average American, which would result in more money in the hands of working-class citizens

-The[World Bank](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/847071452034669879/Global-Economic-Prospects-January-2016-Implications-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Agreement.pdf) and the [USITC](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4607.pdf) both conclude that the TPP will increase U.S welfare while having marginal effects on overall employment and wages.

-Although there has been [one study from Tufts University](https://ideas.repec.org/p/dae/daepap/16-01.html) that found adverse effects on the economies of all nations in the TPP, the study [has been](https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/studies-tpp-which-credible) [scrutinized](https://voxeu.org/article/tpp-structural-reform-let-s-evaluate-it-structural-models) for its flawed methodology.



#**Increased Labor Standards**

-The TPP obliges members to adopt and maintain laws and practices governing “acceptable conditions of work” in three areas: minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health regulations (Article 19.3.2)

-This is in addition to the ILO Declaration which means the International Labour Organization(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up (1998), which include:


1. Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
2. Elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor

3. Effective abolition of child labor
4. Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 

-According to TPP Article 19.6, members “shall also discourage, through initiatives Parties consider appropriate, the importation of goods from other sources produced in whole or in part by forced or compulsory labor, including forced or compulsory child labor.”

#**Enforcement of these labor standards**

-Before addressing the TPP approach, let’s consider the US track record of enforcing labor provisions worldwide. Under the US GSP program, the precedent for enforcing labor provisions was set, which includes a mechanism for filing complaints against beneficiary countries for labor violations, with the option to suspend GSP benefits based on a final determination by USTR. Though trade sanctions are advocated as a “stick” for compliance, the actual removal of trade preferences is often viewed as a last resort. This partly explains the low level of GSP suspensions and trade sanctions. Before GSP was reauthorized, in June 2015, the United States was reviewing labor petitions against Georgia, Niger, the Philippines, Uzbekistan, Thailand, and other countries. 


-One high profile case of action was the decision to suspend the GSP for Bangladesh, which had long been under investigation for its labor practices. The decision came after a global outcry in April 2013, following the collapse of a garment factory that had had aberrant safety regulations, resulting in the death of more than 1,000 people.

-We see that the US is no stranger to labor rights enforcement across the globe

-Now let’s get to the actual TPP itself

-TPP Article 19.5.1 sets the baseline for the agreement’s enforcement: “No Party shall fail to effectively enforce its labor laws through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.”

-Like other US free trade agreements, the TPP establishes a labor council of senior officials at the ministerial level to guide cooperative activities and work programs. The council will meet within one year after the TPP’s entry into force and every two years after that, which would make it unique among other US free trade agreements, which were nonspecific, with the council meeting “as often as it considers necessary.”(Article 19.12)

-”Each Party shall invite the views and, as appropriate, participation of its stakeholders, including worker and employer representatives, in identifying potential areas for cooperation and undertaking cooperative activities”(Article 19.10)

-There are also 3 TPP bilateral labor plans that include implementation and review guidelines, [particularly for Vietnam, which particularly faces poor working conditions and long hours](https://vietnam.oxfam.org/workers%E2%80%99-rights#:~:text=Both%20migrant%20and%20informal%20workers,as%20health%20care%20and%20education.)

1. Government oversight: A standing committee composed of senior US and Vietnamese officials will monitor and ensure rapid response to compliance concerns. Ministerial review of the plan’s implementation will occur at regular intervals (the 3rd, 5th, and 10th years following the entry into force).

2. ILO assistance: Vietnam will establish a technical program with the ILO to support the implementation of proposed reforms, and the ILO will issue a public report two years after entry into force, with biannual meetings after that for eight years.

3. Independent monitoring: A three-member labor expert committee made up of independent non-governmental experts (such as the ILO) will provide reports of the progress toward reforms, with recommendations to the senior officials’ committee two and half years after entry into force and every two years after that(after eight and a half years, reports can continue every five years).


#**Environmental Protection**


1. [TPP takes a series of steps, including levying sanctions and other penalties against individuals or entities engaged in this activity, to combat and prevent the illegal trade of wild flora and fauna.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/environmentalists-praise-wildlife-measures-in-trans-pacific-trade-pact.html?_r=0)

2. The TPP is very clear that it wants to promote the conservation of sharks, whales, dolphins, sea turtles, sea birds, and other marine species. TPP requires countries to institute measures such as “catch limits,” which lay out what and how much can be caught, as well as “bycatch mitigation protections,” which limit the accidental capture of non-targeted animals (Article 20.16.4)

3. TPP protects the ozone layer by limiting the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances that are banned by the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement designed to protect the ozone layer. These substances include refrigerants, coolants, and aerosol-can propellants. TPP also promotes cooperation between countries to increase the development of cost-effective, low-emissions technologies and alternative, clean, and renewable energy sources(Article 20.15.1.) and (Article 20.15.2)

4.[ The TPP eliminates tariffs on numerous environmentally-beneficial goods.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160404160528/http://trade.gov/fta/tpp/industries/energy.asp)

-[As an example, tariffs on wind turbines will immediately go from 5% to duty-free, and parts for solar panels to Brunei will eventually drop from a 20% tariff to duty-free](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Final-Text-Brunei-Tariff-Elimination-Schedule.pdf)(Line 8541.90, page 286 for the lazy) 


-There’s more at https://www.thirdway.org/memo/tpp-in-brief-environmental-standards, but I think the above gives a good picture of what the TPP does environmentally



#**Common Criticism of the TPP**

-The most common, at least among online communities, is the IP law that the TPP imposes, with it effectively setting strict US copyright laws on other countries in it

While valid, I believe that these critiques are  overstated, and this can be summarized with this quote by the Australian Trade Minister that said, “In regard to intellectual property, TPP will not require any changes to Australia’s patent system and copyright regime.”

-Secondly, the IP law of the TPP “would reduce access to health care in poorer countries by increasing costs for life-saving medicine”
-I have no way of verifying if this is true, because, as far as I can tell, no real expert has weighed in on this

-It is important to note that the new CTPP does not include these IP laws


-The other common criticism is that “it would allow corporations to sue x country when they pass a law that hurts their profits.”

-This is unequivocally false as Andrea Bjorklund, an expert on international arbitration and trade law at McGill University, said, “the investor will only recover if the investor can prove a breach of the agreement and can prove a certain measure of damages. So ‘lost profits’ are not a valid basis of claim. Rather, the investor has to allege a violation of the treaty.” She added, “it is true that any investor can attempt to submit a claim and can attempt to justify it as a fair and equitable treatment violation.”

-In simpler terms, this means that a corporation can only sue if it breaches the agreements of the TPP AND it loses profits


#**Is there any hope for the TPP?**
-Before we get to that, it is important to acknowledge that the [CPTPP exits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_and_Progressive_Agreement_for_Trans-Pacific_Partnership) however, it isn’t as strong as the TPP mainly because of the lack of America in it

-In the background section, I mentioned how TPP was “killed” under Trump, but we have a new president now


-[Sadly, it seems like there isn’t much, with Biden saying ""I’m not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education”](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/02/uk-hopes-of-early-us-trade-deal-dashed-by-biden-warning)

 -[An even more dashing blow is the Buy American executive order that Biden has enthusiastically praised](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/biden-executive-orders-manufacturing-buy-american/index.html)

-[However, there is some hope with Biden’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who has come in support of the TPP, as it doesn't allow China to become influential in the region](https://twitter.com/ABlinken/status/823680524686397440)

-Overall, it seems like the TPP will likely not come back, at least not for another couple of years

In 1962, the Tatmadaw launched a coup to create an unusually brutal and xenophobic dictatorship. Myanmar’s ethnic minorities have long been fighting a [civil war](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/12/06/peace-and-war-in-myanmar/) against the Tatmadaw, the Rohingya [faced ](https://burmacampaign.org.uk/media/Myanmar%E2%80%99s-1982-Citizenship-Law-and-Rohingya.pdf)massive discrimination, and Burmans of all ethnicities faced an economy [dominated ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3023620)by the military and a state that offered only poverty. Cracks against the regime first emerged in [1988 ](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-45100041/remembering-the-1988-burma-uprising)when mass protests forced the military to promise free and fair elections. The opposition National League of Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi [won ](https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/26/burma-20-years-after-1990-elections-democracy-still-denied)the elections in a landslide.

However, the military [refused ](https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/11/13/burma-chronology-aung-san-suu-kyis-detention)to accept the results, and forced Aung San Suu Kyi to house arrest for 15 of the next 21 years.  


However, from the 2000s onwards Myanmar started to slowly liberalize. The liberalization [began](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/socar080213b) with the economy, with Myanmar’s economy growing by 8% a year.

However, the Tatmadaw retained substantial power with a quarter of all seats in the legislature, no civilian control of the military and control of the police. The last came to tragedy when the military orchestrated a genocide against the Rohingya people, [killing 24,000](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-rakhine-events/) and forcing nearly a million to flee. While Aung San Su Kyii had little choice but to accept the genocide as a fiat accompli, she has shown little remorse for the actions of the Tatmadaw.

However, the seeds of her own demise lay in her popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

OBLIGATORY VLADIMIR PUTIN INFO:

Vladimir Putin first became president of Russia in 2000, when he won the election with 53% of the vote as an independent. He has proceeded to win the 2004, 2012 and 2018 elections with high double digit victory margins. While consistently registered as an independent during his tenures of presidency, he has been closely aligned with the big tent People's Front party since 2012, which has the tenets of Russian nationalism, Russian conservatism, national conservatism, social conservatism, Putinism and statism. In his first term, his first challenge was the Kursk submarine disaster in which he received much criticism for taking a multitude of days to leave his vacation and visit the scene. He encountered much more success with the Moscow theatre hostage crisis in October of 2002, where despite the death of upwards of 244 people and 700 wounded 83% of Russians approved Putin’s handling of the crisis. Later, a referendum was held in Chechnya which saw Chechnya declared a part of Russia with autonomy. His biggest success in his first term was negotiating a deal with Russian oligarchs where they were allowed to keep most of their power if they supported Putin. Just months after being reelected, Putin had to contend with the Beslan school hostage crisis in September of 2004, where 330 people, 186 of which were children, died. In response Putin enacted a series of anti-terrorism laws, created a new election system where heads of the federal subjects of Russia are proposed by the president and approved by the federal subject legislatures, and consolidated control of Russian media. In 2005 the National Priority Projects were launched by him to combat the drop in life expectancy by improving healthcare, education, housing and agriculture. In his third term he issued the May Decrees, which addressed the economy, education, housing, skilled labor training, EU relations, the defense industry, inter-ethnic relations and other policy areas. In 2013 Putin passed legislation ostensibly to combat “homosexual propaganda”, which banned displays of LGBT symbols. In his fourth term Putin passed constitutional amendments which give him the option to extend his political power after presidency. In March of 2020 Putin had a State Council group formed to combat coronavirus and dispatched Russian Army personnel to Italy to assist the then hardest hit nation in Europe. As the virus progressed in Russia he enacted a series of economic measures which included loan differences, moratoriums on debt collections and cutting social security contributions. As of April of 2020 48% of Russians disapproved of his handling of the pandemic. Throughout his terms Putin has faced a series of domestic issues and backlashes, including multiple assassinations of political rivals and media personnel, as well as large scale protests after virtually every election involving him and the People’s Front party. In terms of foreign policy he has been equally controversial, with major interventions in nearby conflicts such as the Donbass War in Ukraine, the annexation of the Crimea, direct intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and the use of mercenary and special ops groups like the Wagner Group in other conflicts. Putin has been generally hostile to the EU, though has maintained strong economic ties with many EU members such as Germany. He is also believed to have personally ordered Russia to interfere in the 2016 and 2020 US elections with the use of bots and social media manipulation.

I must but a trigger warning at the start of this post, as it involves discussion of both Tara Reade and my own trauma, as my beliefs on the Reade story were *intensely* intertwined with how I was processing my trauma at the time. 

This won't have nearly as many sources as the usual effortpost, because a lot of the concepts in play are pretty straightforward and simple, a lot of them are things I've personally interacted with and implemented, and I'd be linking to a lot of wiki articles. The mechanics of how these concepts were used is the sneaky part, and building understanding of what any people in your lift drifting to the extreme are feeling is important.

One source I do wish to share is one of the organizations whose research was used in developing my understanding of intentional social marketing while I was going to college, and while I don't think a lot of people are formally setting out saying ""I'm going do social marketing interventions to get my audience/others I interact with online to hate Hillary Clinton and Emmanuel Macron,"" but I do think they're using a lot of the same principles to relatively powerful effect.

And, without further ado:

#Intro

I used to be incredibly hard left, briefly a Stalinist, cooled down to just being a person who screeches online about Nancy Pelosi, eventually realized a bunch of things that we'll get to in this post, and realized market forces are useful if directed properly. I don't actually know where I stand but it's somewhere in this realm (currently calling myself a centrist between neolibs and social dem) and this seems like the best forum to post this, because people should know how the mechanics of this aspect of the lefty propaganda influence machine works. 

Anybody who manipulates others in bad faith, playing on their emotional vulnerabilities so they'll buy and push literal misinformation, is an enemy to discourse, and I'm fairly sure the vast majority of people here will agree with this premise.

One of the few things I'm actually qualified to talk a little bit about is social marketing, that is, marketing a product, belief, candidate, behavioral change, etc, vis-a-vis the real or perceived social interactions we have and the opinions we think others have about us. It's interacting with the beliefs we have, interacting with *why* people do behaviors, what social incentives and disincentives and other barriers they have to doing something. This is not about changing *belief,* but *behavior.*

I took three practicums in this shit in college, I fucking love it.

And so it hit me like a truck when I realized I believed that Biden was a literal fascist and rapist (WE'LL FUCKING GET TO THAT PARTICULAR ONE LATER) almost entirely because of the techniques that I had mostly seen utilized to get people to use less water and electricity, to attend a city council meeting, or recycle.

#Social Expectations
What were these techniques? The ones I was most interested in were primarily based on establishing **social expectations.** In the context of recycling, it's things like depicting people who litter as irresponsible and uncaring, encouraging people not to leave the lights on when they leave their house since it looks wasteful and silly to do so.

These influences can be incredibly pervasive while remaining subtle in how they function. If you get the owner of every coffee shop in your town and also the public library and elementary school to have up a poster or sign about some issue, you aren't actually convincing people to do anything by the sign's presence and ability to be read alone.

The purpose of the signs is to show that the owners of the shops care, the members of the community care, the people *you* interact with care. In short, it gives you this subtle influence of thinking people around you care about it and are willing to say so and encourage others to do so publicly. It is expected that others will push it, encourage it. And then, you feel a little weird if you aren't doing it. Ever smoked a cigarette, drank a beer, hit a joint, that you didn't fully want to but still felt like it'd be socially best to? Ever donated to a charity you know nothing about and felt briefly indecisive on but then you thought of what the sad child in the picture would think and feel if you said ""No, you're not worth three dollars?"" It happened to you. It does every day, every time an ad plays on how cool a person in it is, every time sometime references a group identity while making a statement.  

If you're an unethical propagandist, it can take the form of banning anybody who says a single positive word about Joe Biden from your community, or even anybody who thinks that any of the most hyperbolic critiques are absurd. Harassing people who don't fall in line, who express opinions outside of the explicitly approved list, etc. Again, this doesn't influence the people being shouted down. *It encourages onlookers who agree with the people acting this way to also act this way, to become more extreme."" If someone sees that people who disagree get treated like garbage and they start getting hooks in this community, they start needing to believe it.

These methods are most effective on people that are already strongly in favor of something and need reinforcement to go actually do a behavior, OR people who are currently apathetic BUT are in a social context where people care about it and encourage others to do so as well. The effectiveness increases if they're emotionally vulnerable, if they're lonely and detached, if they don't feel super strongly about anything and are looking for meaning, all that. Effectively, people who are more vulnerable to outside influence are more vulnerable to everything that comes with it, and resultantly to the places they spend most of their time.



#My Own Experience On Chapo Before I Was Really, Really, REALLY into it

I've never been good at social interaction, have been Very Online since I was 13. I was an autistic trans kid at a conservative rural school with weird body language and loads of sensory issues, I understandably couldn't really interact with most of my peers very well.

In short, at this point in my life I felt like a dejected loser. I browsed a lot of online communities, made a lot of friends, felt better but drifted away from a lot of them from time to time, and in waxing and waning periods of more and less contact, I'd substitute that empty time with content. When Bernie showed up, it became boatloads of lefty content. A bit unclear on my timeline but it was people like Kulinski, Piker, TYT, all of ""breadtube"" from 2015 to midway through 2020.

It was all about *being the cool person, getting the approval, acting in a way that made me ""good"" by the standards set there.*It didn't matter what the views I was arguing with were, it just mattered that I was right, and that they were wrong.

The Democratic Primaries were happening. Bernie started to lose. People started being massive doomers about everything. My mental health was in the gutter. I was withdrawing from friends I had in real life, I was a bit agoraphobic, all that.

#My Breaking Point: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love their LARP

I will now put another TW and spoiler warning here as it is a description of bad, bad things an ex did that provide context but aren't strictly necessary to understand the post: 
The Tara Reade story broke. I had recently broken up with an incredibly horrifying ex, just a legit user. Most of my friends are convinced that she was a sociopath. &gt;!She did deep and fundamentally violating things, both to my mind and body. She abused the fact that we were both trans women who had been abused to make me trust her to handle things. She had broken my ability to process a lot of my preexisting emotional issues without her, and she added a tat to my body that I won't describe here, as it is distinctive enough that you could identify me with it, as well as policing my body and behavior. I was violated a lot of times. That is all that needs to be said on her. Don't tell me if you do this, but dig back in my account to see my breakdown laid out in real time a year ago as I talk about everything happening, as well as some of what happened in my childhood that she took advantage of.!&lt;

I was traumatized, as a result of what had happened to me, and I was re-traumatized by believing that the presumptive nominee of the Democratic ticket was someone that did things that awful. Chapo banned ANY dissent. If you mentioned anything pro-Biden or establishment or even fucking pro-lesser evil voting to avoid climate apocalypse death, you got banned. 

A lot of the initial outrage was around this intercept article:

https://theintercept.com/2020/03/24/joe-biden-metoo-times-up/

And around the Soundcloud interview you can find by doing a ctrl+F for Katie Halper in that intercept article. 

My opinion on the Tara Reade case now is that it's a blatant fabrication. The story changed over and over, every time to change a detail to look worse for Joe Biden or to make the story look credible again once a prior detail was shown to be false. Every witness who isn't personally connected to her denies the revamp of her story that makes it a full on sexual assault accusation. She has constantly and consistently lied for personal gain throughout her life and claimed to respect and admire the efforts of Joe Biden until 2019, changing a story she held stable for decades.

I was depressed, traumatized, etc, and as such, I was incredibly vulnerable to influences. People in my life would get really concerned if I was browsing Chapo at all while I was talking to them because it kept sending me spiralling over my trauma, but I just *couldn't stop going for it.* Drowning myself in it. I was desperate to perpetually re-open the wound. I was falling away from everything. Friends. Religion. Relationships. My hobbies. My schoolwork. I barely passed my last semester, which was also mid-pandemic. Obsessively online.

#My Part In Perpetuating This 

After I got really deep in the shit, I got aggressively online. I got into arguments with literally hundreds of people about Joe Biden's rape accusations, across 3 or 4 platforms. I had it pushed into me that everyone who believes Joe isn't a literal monster is evil or ignorant and must be castigated or converted. I don't know how many people I convinced of this position but I do know that it's higher than 0. Than 5, 10. I turned this argument into part of my identity, as part of the way I dealt with and took power back from my abuser, and was treated with praise for doing so by a lot of people! I made compelling personal arguments about not voting out of protest for this man who I thought was as awful as the fucking literal sociopath who was manipulating me for years. 

I privately encouraged a few other people to use me as a rhetorical weapon. To say ""my friend was assaulted and is personally hurt by the *concept* that people who claim to support her and people like her will vote for Joe Biden."" I had a sobbing breakdown the next time I was alone when my father didn't instantly buy it because ""you know what happened to me.""

268,"Social Influence, Tara Reade, Deplatforming, and /r/ChapoTrapHouse, Presented Through the Observations of a Former Poster Chapo was banned a while ago, but my opinions have only been put together recently. I must but a trigger warning at the start of this post, as it involves discussion of both Tara Reade and my own trauma, as my beliefs on the Reade story were *intensely* intertwined with how I was processing my trauma at the time. 

This won't have nearly as many sources as the usual effortpost, because a lot of the concepts in play are pretty straightforward and simple, a lot of them are things I've personally interacted with and implemented, and I'd be linking to a lot of wiki articles. The mechanics of how these concepts were used is the sneaky part, and building understanding of what any people in your lift drifting to the extreme are feeling is important.

One source I do wish to share is one of the organizations whose research was used in developing my understanding of intentional social marketing while I was going to college, and while I don't think a lot of people are formally setting out saying ""I'm going do social marketing interventions to get my audience/others I interact with online to hate Hillary Clinton and Emmanuel Macron,"" but I do think they're using a lot of the same principles to relatively powerful effect.

&gt;!Sexual Assault, Emotional Manipulation, Mental Health, Emotional Abuse, Depression&lt;!

And, without further ado:

#Intro

I used to be incredibly hard left, briefly a Stalinist, cooled down to just being a person who screeches online about Nancy Pelosi, eventually realized a bunch of things that we'll get to in this post, and realized market forces are useful if directed properly. I don't actually know where I stand but it's somewhere in this realm (currently calling myself a centrist between neolibs and social dem) and this seems like the best forum to post this, because people should know how the mechanics of this aspect of the lefty propaganda influence machine works. 

Anybody who manipulates others in bad faith, playing on their emotional vulnerabilities so they'll buy and push literal misinformation, is an enemy to discourse, and I'm fairly sure the vast majority of people here will agree with this premise.

One of the few things I'm actually qualified to talk a little bit about is social marketing, that is, marketing a product, belief, candidate, behavioral change, etc, vis-a-vis the real or perceived social interactions we have and the opinions we think others have about us. It's interacting with the beliefs we have, interacting with *why* people do behaviors, what social incentives and disincentives and other barriers they have to doing something. This is not about changing *belief,* but *behavior.*

I took three practicums in this shit in college, I fucking love it.

And so it hit me like a truck when I realized I believed that Biden was a literal fascist and rapist (WE'LL FUCKING GET TO THAT PARTICULAR ONE LATER) almost entirely because of the techniques that I had mostly seen utilized to get people to use less water and electricity, to attend a city council meeting, or recycle.

#Social Expectations
What were these techniques? The ones I was most interested in were primarily based on establishing **social expectations.** In the context of recycling, it's things like depicting people who litter as irresponsible and uncaring, encouraging people not to leave the lights on when they leave their house since it looks wasteful and silly to do so.

These influences can be incredibly pervasive while remaining subtle in how they function. If you get the owner of every coffee shop in your town and also the public library and elementary school to have up a poster or sign about some issue, you aren't actually convincing people to do anything by the sign's presence and ability to be read alone.

The purpose of the signs is to show that the owners of the shops care, the members of the community care, the people *you* interact with care. In short, it gives you this subtle influence of thinking people around you care about it and are willing to say so and encourage others to do so publicly. It is expected that others will push it, encourage it. And then, you feel a little weird if you aren't doing it. Ever smoked a cigarette, drank a beer, hit a joint, that you didn't fully want to but still felt like it'd be socially best to? Ever donated to a charity you know nothing about and felt briefly indecisive on but then you thought of what the sad child in the picture would think and feel if you said ""No, you're not worth three dollars?"" It happened to you. It does every day, every time an ad plays on how cool a person in it is, every time sometime references a group identity while making a statement.  

If you're an unethical propagandist, it can take the form of banning anybody who says a single positive word about Joe Biden from your community, or even anybody who thinks that any of the most hyperbolic critiques are absurd. Harassing people who don't fall in line, who express opinions outside of the explicitly approved list, etc. Again, this doesn't influence the people being shouted down. *It encourages onlookers who agree with the people acting this way to also act this way, to become more extreme."" If someone sees that people who disagree get treated like garbage and they start getting hooks in this community, they start needing to believe it.

These methods are most effective on people that are already strongly in favor of something and need reinforcement to go actually do a behavior, OR people who are currently apathetic BUT are in a social context where people care about it and encourage others to do so as well. The effectiveness increases if they're emotionally vulnerable, if they're lonely and detached, if they don't feel super strongly about anything and are looking for meaning, all that. Effectively, people who are more vulnerable to outside influence are more vulnerable to everything that comes with it, and resultantly to the places they spend most of their time.



#My Own Experience On Chapo Before I Was Really, Really, REALLY into it

I've never been good at social interaction, have been Very Online since I was 13. I was an autistic trans kid at a conservative rural school with weird body language and loads of sensory issues, I understandably couldn't really interact with most of my peers very well.

In short, at this point in my life I felt like a dejected loser. I browsed a lot of online communities, made a lot of friends, felt better but drifted away from a lot of them from time to time, and in waxing and waning periods of more and less contact, I'd substitute that empty time with content. When Bernie showed up, it became boatloads of lefty content. A bit unclear on my timeline but it was people like Kulinski, Piker, TYT, all of ""breadtube"" from 2015 to midway through 2020. 

This is tbh a bit embarrassing to admit given how I feel about it in retrospect, but...

I posted there fairly obsessively, or I should say browsed. Constantly. It was the first link in my bookmark bar and I clicked it a lot. I fucked *loved* Chapo. I made a lot of comments far down in threads pulling ""dunks"" on people who were part far right fascists picking fights but also with a lot of people who were just frustrated with a hundred thousand jackasses larping in unison about their correctness. It was all about *being the cool person, getting the approval, acting in a way that made me ""good"" by the standards set there.*It didn't matter what the views I was arguing with were, it just mattered that I was right, and that they were wrong.

This isn't the main point of the post, but I was asked elsewhere about it, so I should include here.

I dug out by improving my mental health, getting in contact with my non-dipshit-extremist-circlejerk supports again, getting back in therapy, doing things to feel self efficacy.

Also I watched a whole lot of Destiny videos and debates about leftism, and had a few people in my personal life talk to me about policy. (Lmao I'm still banned from Destiny's sub for being a former chapo user and they never respond to the unban request)

Watching people actually discuss concepts, especially people I used to look at as respectable or intelligent, and to see them get ripped apart was kind of a wake-up call. A big, big point in me realizing this was his debate with Pxie about the Tara Reade accusations, and how when I slowed down to look at everything I really, really didn't have a good reason to feel as strongly as I did other than other people encouraging me to. 

Getting back into other hobbies, into religion, into other things I just enjoy engaging with and that actively improve my life, pulled me back from the edge of becoming just an ideologue. 

I've stopped talking to a lot of the people who were my friends then. They were too committed to the bullshit. They were too mean to people who were outsiders, and I was one then. If you start expressing genuine doubt, pulling away, they'll either try to pull you in or kick you out if it's not working. Actually discussing the reality of the situation was a taboo. I don't know if it works for all other people like this but if people try to choose what I can and can't say for me it freaks me out. When I just said the same things they did I didn't notice.

#Deplatforming 

Another part of how I managed to get out was that one day I woke up and Chapo was just fucking gone. I was unironically weirdly aimless and listless for the next 3 days whenever I had downtime. I wasn't able to do my usual habit of triggering my PTSD by reading shitposts about Biden's evil or fake outrage about nonsense. I literally HAD TO do something else. There wasn't another place quite like Chapo, it had a unique vibe, a unique sense, a unique humor, and without it the aesthetic core of the bullshit I believed in was gone and my attachment to the issues Chapo cared most about slowly started to wane.

#Miscellaneous Examples Of Establishing Social Expectations

I'm going to include here a few *really* obvious examples of people trying to clumsily make it so people think the only opinion it's acceptable to say it there.

Here's a TYT video about Amy Klobuchar where they lie and claim she said the opposite of what she did!

https://www.facebook.com/CenkUygurOfficial/videos/senator-amy-klobucharwhat-are-you-doing/734829663811319/

You see, they claim that anyone that agrees with her opinion is trying to ""dumb their way out of helping Americans"" and ""just suck, just suck.""

Her actual claim was that Trump showboating by threatening a veto on the 600 dollar checks when 2k checks weren't on the table was a threat to people because getting 600 dollars sucks less than getting 0 dollars, and getting continued unemployment is more relevant to a LOT of the people most affected by the pandemic.

By forcing the expectation that anyone who agrees with Klobuchar hates you and wants you to suffer, you make it so anyone who agrees with her gets attacked instantly.


https://youtu.be/vOvkPYqdjTE?t=3754

My next (this time timestamped!) example is Bri Joy-Gray debating Sam Seder about ""Force the Vote,"" which I am including because it is content explicitly by and for the left, and Bri, as a former media director, is incredible at bowling people over rhetorically with performative outrage.

She is supposed to be talking to Sam Seder about the merits of forcing a Medicare for All vote by holding up the speakership. They both agree that the fundamental goal is to get a shared policy across. What does she do? She starts denouncing the way that Sam is unwilling to focus on the fight for the right of millions of people to healthcare. They *already agree* and she is both affecting strong emotion and acting unnecessarily aggressive at him claiming that trying to get your dream policy vote with a contingent of 6 people is probably unwise. She is again an example of creating and pushing an expectation that disagreeing makes you bad, and strongly agreeing makes you good. 

The biggest whopper though, came recently. I don't need to give a single link because if you look at a single video on left youtube about stocks from a week ago, everybody I saw on the fucking PLANET but Destiny's stream and here were desperately promoting the working man's retail investment revolt, how it was fighting the man, getting one up on the big guys, and robinhood shutting down trades was just them STEALING IT from us. So I will link you one tweet in particular that epitomizes it.

https://twitter.com/KyleKulinski/status/1355573696119889921?s=20

Robinhood got the billion so it could OPEN UP TRADING AGAIN. Kyle is directly stating the opposite and follows it up by complaining that the critiques of him are pathetically stupid and need to try harder. If someone actually respected him and saw these takes they'd probably end up having some unpleasant kneejerk responses, and push them in casual conversation, pushing the cycle further.

*Note: My apologies if I at times engage in “both-sides-ism” in this post, it was meant for a more general audience than r/NeoLiberal and often times that is the best way to make a point about tribalism to mixed audience. Additionally, I am not highly familiar with Reddit formatting and as such some things might look peculiar. Thank you for reading.*

Identity with a political tribe has taken supreme precedence over matters such as ideology. Blind allegiance is rewarded, not independence, thoughtful consideration, or compromise. Dissent has lost much of its political prestige, the respect, if begrudging, for those “profiles in courage” has largely evaporated. Courageous senators of a time not long past were once applauded for their courage, if not their action (Wayne Morse on the Gulf of Tonkin, James Buckley on Watergate, Charles Goodell on Vietnam, or Howard Baker on the Panama Canal)a When we do see courageous political dissent (e.g from John McCain on the Affordable Care Act or Joe Manchin on the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh), its emissaries are greeted with only contempt. The descent of politics into a conflict between groups held in near religious reverence by their followers is antithetical to democracy itself and seems to absolve its participants from the basic rigors of civility. Civil disagreement is trumped by a hatred reminiscent of that between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. From Jesse Helms, Newt Gingrich, or the “Tea Party” on the right to Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, and the “Justice Democrats” of the left, polarization has grown steadily worse.

These partisan tribes develop norms that are then used as the standards for partisan to be conforming group members. As people identify with a group more strongly, they conform to these tribal norms to appear as “good” members of their tribe, and those who do not conform to the tribal norms are targeted by the extremists within the tribe through systems such as primaries. For instance, Republican Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina lost a 2010 primary to Trey Gowdy by 40 points despite having a 93% rating from the American Conservative Union due to Inglis’s support of climate legislation, a post recession bailout, and his opposition to the 2007 troop surge in Iraq. Even dissent as minor as Representative Inglis’s can trigger a tribal reaction from the group. Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler campaigns extensively on her voting record of siding with President Trump on 100% of votes, in my view it is a sad reflection on the state of our political process if an absolute lack of dissent is applauded by one’s supporters. 

In 2016 researchers assembled 1,178 Washingtonians for a study on how partisanship affected their perception of a ballot measure that would institute a carbon tax. The group was divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats; those groups were further divided into a groups viewing Republican endorsements of the policy and Democratic opposition, and a group viewing Republican opposers to the policy and Democratic endorsers. While Republicans continually opposed the policy, they were much more prone to supporting it when told that famous Republicans such as George Shultz (An advisor to the Eisenhower Administration, Nixon’s Secretary of Labor and the Treasury, and finally Reagan’s Secretary of State) had endorsed the policy. This gap was only more pronounced among the well educated in these groups. Global warming is an existential threat to humanity itself, yet our views on it are largely informed due to partisan biases as opposed to scientific fact. 

**The Media’s Role:**

The Soviet Union’s propaganda newspaper was entitled Pravda, Russian for truth, so too does Fox News’ motto of “Fair and Balanced” disguise propaganda and an impartiality taken seriously by few. Politics is not a sport, to create policy and build a united nation compromise is second only to the understanding of other’s beliefs. Media-be it from the right or left-portrays political happenings as a conflict between two teams, with a “win” being valued over the nation’s wellbeing, and, as the saying goes, perception often becomes reality. The facile portrayal of politics as a sport in news has led political discourse to increasingly adopt these characteristics. Media gains views through sensationalism and the portrayal of politics as a horse race, but in doing so it preys on our divisions and often provides a platform to those such as climate change deniers or other conspiracy theorists who normally would be shut from the arena of mainstream political belief. As Carlton University professor Jim Davies explains, “everything about the news—from the dramatic headlines to the riveting background music to the colors on the screen (lots of red, which experts agree is one of, if not the most, emotionally charged color)—is engineered to prey on our hardwired impulses to pay attention to what seems exciting and important. The manner in which the news is presented—be it on television or the social feeds on our phone—often triggers the release of dopamine, a powerful neurochemical that tags experiences as meaningful and makes us want to seek them over and over again.” 

The national motto of the United States is “E Pluribus Unum” or “Out of Many, One”. Humans are naturally tribal creatures, but our founders understood that democracy requires us to embrace pluralism and unite our many tribes into one united nation. Social media is in diametric opposition to these principles, sorting us into tribal echo chambers by way of clandestine algorithms that dehumanize our opposition and do no more than confirm our biases. Social media has also opened the door to foreign interference in our elections and the inflammation of our tribal instincts by way of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian propaganda. Foreign disinformation now colors our view of our fellow Americans and of our democratic processes themselves. Anti-democratic actors such as Father Coughlinb harnessed the new technology of radio to fan the flames of fascism, but today we are faced with thousands of Fathers Coughlin spreading disinformation not in weekly radio broadcasts, but in a never-ending firehose of social media extremism that pushes our society deeper into division. Tom Wheeler of the Brooking’s Institution put it well; “digital technology is gnawing at the core of democracy by dividing us into tribes and devaluing truth.” 
**The Importance of Interaction:**

I would argue that the best way to stymie hateful tribalism in the media is not to legislation, but often very minor actions taken by us. I would argue two primary actions should be taken; firstly, one should view media from across the political spectrum; secondly, one should engage in discussion with those you disagree with. As Zachary Wood explained in a “Ted Talk”, “tuning out opposing viewpoints doesn't make them go away, because millions of people agree with them. In order to understand the potential of society to progress forward, we need to understand the counterforces.” People increasingly do not interact with ideas they oppose, and in doing so they lose an understanding of those ideas and come to regard their opponents as what is known as “strawmen”, as Krysta Scripter explains “Especially when we hold a strong opinion, it's increasingly less likely that we're talking [..] with anyone who disagrees.” Interaction with those we disagree with also fosters intellectual humility, defined by the Journal of Positive Psychology as “the ability to have an accurate view of one’s intellectual strengths and limitations and the ability to negotiate ideas in a fair and inoffensive manner. “ It has been shown that this intellectual humility can not only improve one’s learning abilities, but their social skills as well. 

The engagement with other’s ideas also reinforces the ideal of pluralism, which is often considering an underpinning of democracy. Pluralism, defined by Oxford as “a condition or system in which two or more states, groups, principles, sources of authority, etc., coexist.”, allows for a democracy in which diverse ideas are expected to compete, if we cannot coexist with others, we cannot properly function as a democracy. For instance, Marwan Muasher, a Middle Eastern policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that a lack of pluralism has been a defining factor in the destabilization of many areas in the Middle East. By interacting with others, we are learning for ourselves while helping support the foundations of democracy.

 **System of the Fringes:**

The factors contributing to partisanship can be traced to the very roots of our electoral systems themselves. Closed partisan primaries, gerrymandering, and our first past the post voting system collaborate to enable a vocal minority of extremists to hold final sway over our electoral process. Only a small percentage of eligible voters even bother to vote in primaries, and these are commonly the most extreme of the electorate. As former U.S Representative Mickey Edwards(R-OK) notes, only 8% of the total Alabama electorate voted for far-right Judge Roy Moore over incumbent Senator Luther Stranged in the 2017 Republican special election primary, and Strange was by all means more popular among the general electorate than Moore, yet it was Moore who advanced to the general election. In Nebraska’s Second Congressional District progressive Democrat Kara Eastman lost to Republican Don Bacon by 4.8% even as Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden carried the district by nearly 6 points; Eastman’s moderate Democratic primary opponent Ann Ashford would have been very likely to win the seat. Candidates such as Moore or Eastman are able to win primaries, and thus advance to be one of two, or even the only, competitive candidate in a general election by appealing to small yet vocal aspects of the electorate. The bottom line is clear: primaries do not represent the electorate. 

The second issue I would cite is gerrymandering, which is closely connected to the first. Gerrymandering, named for Vice President Elbridge Gerrye, is a practice in which legislatures draw legislative districts in such a way as to maximize the benefits of one political party; Gerrymandering has been a persistent issue throughout American history, but it has become more significant than ever as of late. Competitive elections are a cornerstone of democracy yet Gerrymandering reduces the value of elections while removing competition, allowing politicians to become increasingly radical without facing serious electoral hurdles. A study by Antoine Yoshinaka and Chad Murphy found that “members of the out-of-power party tended to have more drastic changes made to their districts as a way for the in-power party to insulate its members”. For instance, as the Brenna Center for Justices notes that gerrymandering in Maryland removed Republican Roscoe Bartlett in 2012. Maryland’s gerrymandering also means that (relatively) far left Representatives such as Kweisi Mfume and (relatively) far right Representative Andy Harris are both consistently re-elected by large margins; ideally both districts would overlap with more significant support for the other party and ensure competitive elections. Furthermore, if congressional districts were drawn to ensure and encourage competition, the congressional balance would be taken out of the hands of a small number of voters in swing districts. Some would argue that this would allow parties to seize supermajorities, I would disagree as in a congressional map drawn to be as competitive as possible it is unlikely that any party would be able to win all of the competitive seats, and if this were to happen the party would have to have moved to the center enough that it would represent the majority will. 

Thirdly, our “first past the post” voting system is flawed. The system allows for phenomena such as “vote splitting” and allows candidates to win with small shares of the vote, as low as under 30% in some primaries or 35% in general elections. This system allows candidates to succeed with wedges of the public and disempowers third parties. For instance, in 1974 former U.S Representative Ray Blanton won the Democratic primary with 22.7% of the vote, Blanton would defeat Republican Lamar Alexander in the general election but his single term as Governor would be marred by scandal and RealClearPolitics would name him one of the “Ten Most Corrupt Politicians” in American history, in the final days of his governorship, he would infamously pardon two dozen convicted murderers and 28 others in exchange for money.

Great political leaders of the past-LBJ, Sam Rayburn, Howard Baker, Bob Dolef-understood the importance of compromise, and only through that understanding were they able to achieve the legislative reforms they did, yet legislative leaders today stifle the legislative process and focus instead on their own interests, putting party above democracy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell(R-KY) has long been known as a master of legislative obstruction not seen since the days of James Alleng, while Representative Justin Amash has said of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s tactics “We have not been allowed to offer amendments on the House floor in more than four years. In effect, every bill we vote on is take it or leave it.”. That being said, there are still those who value compromise, such as Senator Diane Feinstein(D-CA) or retiring Senator Lamar Alexander(R-TN), but our legislative leaders, enabled by primaries and our voting system, largely stymie attempts at compromise.

**A Framework for Unity:**

The majority of Americans are exhausted with partisan tribalism. Most Americans are not far right or far left, yet both sides maintain caricatures of one another, and an increasing number of Americans confine themselves to partisan-not necessarily ideological-echo chambers that fail to provide them with the support for pluralism and understanding of opposing views that is critical to democracy. I argue that three crucial electoral reforms should be instituted, a commission to end gerrymandering, a blanket primary, and ranked choice voting. 
States have consistently altered their primary systems since Robert La Follette popularized the idea in the early 1900s, one, Indiana, went farther. Indiana was a hotbed of the  Klux Klan during the organization’s second wave and officials as influential as the state’s Governor were members of the terrorist group. Members of the Klan were significantly more likely to vote in primaries than any other group and could seize control of the political system due to their high turnout rates in these primaries, this led Indiana to largely do away with the primary system for local elections in 1928; they would not be restored until the mid 1970s. That being noted, I would not advocate for the abolition of primaries, instead I would argue for abolishing the partisan requirements tied to primaries. States such as Vermont allow one to choose whether to vote in the Republican or Democratic primaries in the state regardless of party affiliation, allowing independents and others into the fold and enabling the primary to be more representative.

That being said, some have gone farther and instituted the now largely forgotten “blanket primary”, which I would argue would be the best alternative. A blanket primary system allows voters to vote in any party’s primary for different offices, with the candidate with the best showing from each party advancing to the general election, : this system commonly produced consensus candidates. Washington and Alaska long maintained a “blanket primary” system, which contributed to both states being quite competitive, as liberal Republicans such as Daniel Evans won in the generally Democratic state of Washington. A blanket primary was adopted by California in the 1996, but the Supreme Court overruled decades of precedent in the 2001 decision California Democratic Party v. Jones and deemed the blanket primary unconstitutional. The reasoning in this decision, put forth by Justice Scalia in a 7-2 decisionh, was that parties can govern their own affairs; I would disagree and argue that this falls out of the scope of a “party affair” and would posit that it is an affair of the people and furthermore argue the decision was a violation of states’ rights. As Justice Stevens puts it in his dissent “A State's power to determine how its officials are to be elected is a quintessential attribute of sovereignty.”

Secondly how can gerrymandering be stymied, and how should we redraw the maps? I would suggest one of two solutions, either an algorithm or a nonpartisan committee to redistrict. I would argue congressional maps are best drawn in a manner that would ensure the highest number of competitive districts. FiveThirtyEight, a polling and analysis website ran by Nate Silver, recently released a series of 8 congressional maps gerrymandered in various ways, one of these is drawn to maximize competition. The maximized competition map includes 242 highly competitive districts, this ensures that one’s vote is likely to have a significant impact while ensuring that elections are not confined to several dozen congressional districts, practically disenfranchising large portions of the electorate. As David Daley of the electoral reform organization FairVote notes “If your goal is to reduce polarization, this system would reduce the oversized influence of partisan voters in low-turnout primaries, give moderate and independent voters more choices, and empower the broader electorate that turns out in November general elections”.

Finally, how we can reform our voting system itself. Several ideas have gained popularity, including approval voting (utilized in Bismarck, North Dakota), but by and large the most popular is ranked choice voting, Maine uses ranked choice voting in its elections, and Alaska recently approved a referendum to do so as well. Ranked choice voting would allow people to rank every candidate for an office in order of preference, candidates are eliminated in each round and their votes redistributed to their second choice until a candidate possesses a majority vote. The majority requirement ensures that candidates possess a true mandate for their policies: other effects of ranked choice voting include more moderate candidates as candidates are required to appeal to a larger segment of the electorate, less tribalism and a more civil political culture as candidates are competing for the second or third choice votes of those who may support another candidate as their first-choice vote, and the negation of the “spoiler effect”. 

Opponents of ranked-choice voting make several arguments, well summarized in the Heritage Foundation piece “Ranked Choice Voting Is A Bad Choice” but the primary argument is the claim that in a ranked-choice system, one could vote for a candidate they greatly dislike, whom they ranked quite low. I would object vehemently to this argument. Firstly, one would never vote for the candidate they ranked last, and if one were not comfortable voting for multiple candidates they could leave them out of their rankings. Secondly, one will only vote for a candidate ranked low on their ballot if the election is down to that candidate and the candidate or candidates one has ranked lower. For example, if one were to have ranked every third-party presidential candidate above Joe Biden and Donald Trump in this election but still ranked Biden above Trump, their vote would have gone to their second least favored candidate, but only because the alternative was a candidate they favored even less.
Our political system is in chaos, and technologies such as social media exacerbate these issues. Electoral reform and reforms to our manner of politics are, frankly, the only way we can escape this political quagmire for brighter pastures.

a.. The four acts of “political courage” I reference here are as follows; Wayne Morse(D-OR) being one of two Senators to oppose the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution; James Buckley(R/C-NY) being the first conservative Senator to call for the resignation of President Nixon; Appointed Senator Charles Goodell(R-NY) opposing the Vietnam War, an action which led to his defeat in the 1970 election, losing the support even of the Nixon White House; and Republican Senate Leader Howard Baker(R-TN) aiding President Carter with negotiations surrounding the Panama Canal, which may have cost him the 1980 Republican presidential nomination.
b. Father Charles Coughlin was a radio priest from the late 1930s and early 1940s infamous for his advocacy for, arguably, fascist policies and for sympathizing with the enemy during WWII, his weekly broadcasts attracted millions of listeners until he was removed from air early in WWII, although he continued to preside over his church until his death in the late 1970s.
c. The strawman fallacy is defined by Wikipedia as “a form of argument and an informal fallacy of having the impression of refuting an argument, whereas the proper idea of argument under discussion was not addressed or properly refuted.”
d. I would note that Senator Strange was an appointed incumbent, but an incumbent nonetheless, and one who had demonstrated relative popularity with the general electorate in the past before.
e. Gerry was Governor of Massachusetts at the time of the redistricting, and in fairness to him, he was reluctant to support the redistricting bill. The term “gerrymander” comes from a political cartoon soon after the bill was passed.
f. LBJ refers to Lyndon Baines Johnson, I refer more so to his work as Senate Majority Leader from 1953-1960 than to his work in the Presidency. Sam Rayburn, the longest serving Speaker of the House in American history, was LBJ’s counterpart from 1953-1960 and served as Speaker until his death in 1961, both Texans, Rayburn was a significant influence on LBJ and in some ways served as a father figure. Howard Baker served as Republican Senate Leader from 1977-`985, the last four of those years at Majority Leader. Bob Dole served as Baker’s successor, both were influential legislators who valued bipartisanship.
g. James “Jim” Allen served as a Senator from Alabama from 1969-1977 and was an infamous master of senate rules. Allen’s behavior almost single handedly led to the lowering of the filibuster threshold from 67 votes to 60, I would recommend Walter Mondales’s account of the matter, which may be found in his memoir, “The Good Fight”.
h. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens dissented.

308,"Term limits are not a good idea I've seen quite a few people on here praising term limits as a one size fits all solution to a whole suite of problems.  I decided to write a brief essay (Less than 5000 words!) to summarize some of the literature on term limits and why they're generally a fuckin awful idea.  Happy to include more detail if this isn't seen as comprehensive enough (it's not there are literally thousands of pages on the subject).  

Congressional term limits are often bandied about as a solution to growing discontent among voters.  The logic goes that time in Washington is naturally corrupting.  As they spend time in Washington, Senators and Congresspeople become increasingly powerful.  As the old saying goes, power corrupts.  There is wisdom in this saying but vesting power in individuals is an essential part of representative government.  Arbitrarily removing this power regardless of performance, the preference of the voters, or the corrupting effects of a revolving door, is equal parts short sighted and dangerous.  

Let us begin with the strongest argument that term limit advocates propose.  By instituting a hard stop on someone’s time in office you minimize the risk of corruption.  The evidence points to exactly the opposite effect. 
Firstly, term limits weaken the legislature.  The United States is already experiencing a resurgent Imperial Presidency under presidents Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden.  Weakening the legislature in the face of a more powerful executive seems foolhardy at best.  Given the relative weakness of the United States legislature it is effectively suicidal.  Currently, we are witnessing the GOP transforming from the party of Romney to the party of Trump, this is occurring more rapidly as moderate senators, those same senators that would be more quickly ejected under term limits, are replaced by more extreme senators.  Term limits would naturally hasten this process.  Imagine congress under the control of an even more Trump friendly legislature over the last 4 years.  Imagine Republican Senators competing in competitive primary contests at the peak of Trump’s popularity.  It would quickly become a race to become Marjorie Taylor Greene.  

This hypothetical alone is not the only piece of evidence that term limits weaken the legislature.  Term limited members pay less attention to their constituent interests and spend less time on legislation.  Additionally, term limited legislators do not bring additional value to their constituents by building long last relationships, both within their own caucus and across the aisle, nor do they tend to write new legislation, solve problems, or create law at the same rate as their non-term limited colleagues (Carey, Niemi, and Powell 1998; Carey et al. 2006).  Chamber leaders become weaker (Carey et al, 1998; 2006).  This leads to legislatures tending to defer to their governor, concentrating increasing power in the hands of the executive (Powell 2007).  Governors are not the only beneficiary; unelected Bureaucrats also see an increase in power.  They simply know more about the system and can turn that knowledge advantage into gains (Carey et al. 2006, Powell 2007).
Simply put, term limits weaken legislatures and empower non-legislative actors.  If the argument that power corrupts applies to legislators certainly it should also apply to governors, bureaucrats and every other actor who will capitalize on the weakened legislature.  

Another powerful argument on the side of term limits is that they will reduce the power of interest groups.  This is intuitive on the surface, but multiple studies have found no statistically significant difference in term-limited versus non term-limited legislatures and their ability to fend off interest groups.  In fact, surveys of interest groups suggest that the opposite is occurring and that term-limited legislators are more interested in interest groups (Carey, Niemi, and Powell 1998; Mooney 2007; Berman 2005; Cain and Kousser 2004; Moncrief and Thompson 2001; Sarbaugh-Thompson et al. 2004: Straayer and Bowser 2004).  This can be chalked up again to information asymmetry.  When someone from an interest group approaches you as a new senator, with colleagues that may have a term, maybe two under their belt as your only mentor, you are more likely to be persuaded, conned, or otherwise influenced by interest groups.  Basically, new senators are heckin easy to bamboozle xD.  Or, more formally, they become more corruptible. 
 
Of the above conclusions Miller, Jill Nicholson-Crotty, and Sean Nicholson-Crotty, (2011) have developed a series of 24 sophisticated statistical models that further reinforce the findings of their previous authors.  In fact, many of these authors understated their case showing that non-legislative actors could see their relative influence increase by leaps and bounds.  The only positive aspect of this is that party leaders are made weaker, but again, given the relative weakness of party leaders (Mitch McConnell likely has no love for Trump, but voted to acquit anyway because the party did not want him to convict, despite him choosing to acquit 7 members of his party voted to convict anyway) further weakening them and allowing the inmates further control over the proverbial asylum seems unwise.",1,0.107,0.734,0.159,0.9957

As a reminder for anyone who needs or wants it, for when you're concerned about people who think Biden = Trump, who are on the weird end of the left side of the culture war, who think we should lock down forever or wear masks all the time, etc.

Part of that is true concern regarding a small minority of people.  However, once you start ascribing it to a large number of people, you might be falling into a longtime partisan weapon that I've illustrated here:  https://i.imgur.com/X2H5x6y.png

People will naturally fear things like a ""PC police"" that will punish them for any slip-up of any magnitude, a ""new normal"" that's just ""constant lockdown,"" having to wear masks forever, a government that thinks math is racist, etc.  Thankfully, *none of those things have any chance at enough support to really be implemented, and if they were, the reaction would be strong enough to hand nationwide power directly to the Republicans.*

For example:  there was the ""pronoun law"" in Canada, that people thought would make it so you could go to jail for misgendering someone.  I saw a shit-ton of right wingers warning about it, a bunch of ""concerned moderates,"" and even some left wingers starting to consider that perhaps Canada was going too far.  This may have been pushed along by the existence of a small group of people on Twitter who liked the idea, and whenever that happens, right wingers amplify those tweets as much as possible to play up the opposition.

The point here is that **the right wing utilizes fears that people on the left are going off the rails, in an attempt to push people in the middle into a reactionary response.**  They do this using both fringe left wing ideas, misinterpretations of more acceptable left wing ideas.  Don't fall for it.

**In conclusion,** whenever you're wondering at some radical culture-war-style position that you're concerned about engulfing the left wing, it might have some effects somewhere on the local level somewhere like San Francisco, but take a moment and consider how the average person outside of the internet would see said radical position, compared to middle-of-the-road Democratic positions.  If you fall for reactionary weapons, you will pass it on to others, and it will continue to spread like a virus.

Next up is Recep Erdogan!

&amp;#x200B;

OBLIGATORY RECEP ERDOGAN INFO:

Recep Erdogan won his first presidential election in 2014 as a member of the Justice and Development Party with 51.8% of the vote, for reference the second place candidate got 38.4% of the vote. He won re-election in 2018 with 52.6% of the vote, for reference the second place candidate got 30.6% of the vote. The Justice and Development Party is a right wing political party that has the tenants of conservatism, social conservatism, national conservatism, right-wing populism, neo-Ottomanism, economic nationalism and Erdoganism. Domestically Erdogan has focused on consolidating government control and power, including the seizure of the magazine Zaman in 2016, meeting much flak from the international community. Just months later he regarded himself as successful in destroying civil groups which he deemed as working against the state. This was accelerated after the 2016 coup wherein 200 journalists were arrested and 120 media outlets were closed. Additionally, restrictions and regulations were emplaced against online sites such as YouTube, Netflix and Wikipedia, the latter being banned for two and a half years. This ties to a larger series of purges conducted after the 2016 coup with tens of thousands being arrested and even more losing their jobs. In 2017 he passed legislation that made it illegal for the legislative branch to investigate the executive branch, raising many to say that Turkey had effectively lost its democratic status. For reference, the coup conducted against Erdogan in 2016 criticized him for eroding secularism, dismantling democracy, violating human rights and loss of international credibility, fairly rare statements for a military coup to issue. Beyond the coup and consolidation of power, in 2018 Erdogan had to contend with a currency and debt crisis as the Lira plummeted in value, high inflation, rising borrowing costs, and correspondingly rising loan defaults. While success has been had in countering the crisis, the effects of the crisis were still felt well into 2019, shortly before coronavirus struck Turkey. In terms of foreign policy Erdogan has strengthened relations with Maduro and Venezuela, supporting the former against the US and strengthened economic ties, including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold being sent to Istanbul. With China trade has increased multiple fold, with Erdogan seeing China as a potential ally as displayed in his statements regarding the possibility of joining the Shanghai Pact over the European Union. Under his leadership Turkey has taken a direct involvement in the Syrian Civil War, supporting various rebel groups with allegations of funds and weapons going to the Islamic State. Additionally Turkey has effectively conducted war against the Kurds of northern Syria, launching a multitude of airstrikes against them and going so far as to launch a limited invasion to create a buffer area between the Kurds and Turkey. Erdogan has openly stated his intentions to end Assad's rule in Syria. Erdogan has consistently supported Palestine in the Israel-Palestine Conflict, with tensions growing between Erdogan and Netanyahu as the latter has conducted increasingly hostile actions against the Palestinians. Relations between Erdogan and Europe have been frosty at best with Erdogan stating that Cyprus will be Turkish ""forever"", and has taken an increasingly hostile stance against Greece with disputes over islands in the Aegean Sea. Erdogan supported Azerbaijan during the brief 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War. He has stated that Crimea is occupied territory which rightfully belongs to Ukraine. Finally, relations with the United States has grown colder as Erdogan has increased military cooperation with Russia with purchases of Russian equipment. After the sanction of two senior Turkish government officials, Erdogan stated that these actions will force Turkey to look for new friends and allies.

344,"Biden privately tells governors: Minimum wage hike likely isn’t happening When Joe Biden met with a group of mayors and governors last week he bluntly told them to get ready for a legislative defeat: his proposed minimum wage hike was unlikely to happen, he said, at least in the near term.

“I really want this in there but it just doesn't look like we can do it because of reconciliation,” Biden told the group, according to a person in the room. “I’m not going to give up. But right now, we have to prepare for this not making it.”

The comments, which were confirmed by two other people familiar with the conversation, were the furthest Biden has gone in conceding the coming axing of the $15-an-hour minimum wage provision from his first major legislative package. And they suggest that the president is more inclined to manage the fallout of it not being included than to pursue long-shot, political-capital consuming efforts to fight for its insertion.

Sitting in the Oval Office with Republican and Democratic elected officials last Friday to advocate for his $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, he didn’t hide his skepticism.

“Doesn’t look like we can do it,” he said of the minimum wage hike.

356,"Why Bernie lost the black vote I know it’s a bit outdated considering we are past the primaries and Trump lost and all but I’m new to the sub Reddit and recently been looking over key factors that show that in the end the DNC aren’t the ones to blame for Bernie supporters who are mad that he lost again. So yours truly is black and all of my family are moderate democrats. They voted the same party for every elections as soon the Republicans strayed themselves from the party of Lincoln to the party that embraces racists from the sidelines. 

Obviously most of the popular suggestions from modern Republicans negatively impacts the African American community. Things like making voting harder instead of easier, not acknowledging that the current police as we have it is flawed and can be fixed with a reform but NOT REVOLUTION, and the basics of embracing racism as part of the brand ((the wall, anti Mexico for some weird reason, complementing proud boys)). These scare away black voters as to your average person, it seems like voting republicans currently will strip someone of their rights ((this goes further than just black people but the impact is still the same)).

Now I’m fully aware that Biden did in fact lie about marching with MLK and that Bernie did participate in the marches of Civil rights. I appreciate this as now for the most part, I can go anywhere and don’t have to fear about being discriminated  for the color of my skin. But the Bernie bros keep saying this key line that makes me feel like they believe black people are stupid,  which I feel is just as hateful as Trump’s comments. “Oh black people keeps voting against their own wishes” or “Oh the black people are just misinformed about Bernie’s policies”. 

So you are telling me just because he did March with MLK I should feel obligated to vote for him? These statements to says to me that gives the idea that Bernie bros think of it like this “if you don’t agree with my idea, you are wrong and hurting yourself.” Doing one rally in the 60’ doesn’t prove to me you’ll be any more better than anyone else at helping black people. Plus like it or not, Obama has a grip on the Democratic Party until he dies. Obama himself may not like it but it is what it is. And Bernie shot himself in the foot by A) disagreeing with Obama multiple times ((which Biden later used on his attack ads against Bernie)) B) Thinking about trying to primary the FIRST black president ((the same president who got 96% of the black vote, meaning he’s very influential in the black Democratic Party)) and C) By basically criticizing Obama at one point then using the Obama card later on to appeal to black votes, he messed up his shot again, because now it seems extremely hypocritical. That is hurtful because it gives the idea that ONLY Bernie’s policies are correct and everything else is wrong. Saying that black people are stupid for voting for anyone who isn’t Bernie. The little amount of black vote that Bernie did get was from younger black people. Which we already know aren’t dependable when it comes to voting. And this doesn’t even apply to all young black people. 

I’m in the young demographic of black people and disagree about his policies. Doesn’t mean I’m a closet racist who hates myself or that I’m a DINO. Just from what I know, some policies look good on paper but impossible with real time as even if Bernie had a supermajority in the house and the senate, because a large chunk would be moderates and aren’t exactly happy with all the progressive ideals.

Bernie lost the black vote because he comes from a state that is VERY white and the first states that do give a vote on who’s leading in the primaries are VERY white too. As soon as Bernie came across a state with a large black population he lost big time. He lost because his policies were universal and what happens is that black people slip through the cracks and end up hurt again. This is why he needed policies specific to certain groups of people or it was going to scare any large black population to stay with the moderate democrats because the voting block knows without the vote of black people, any democrat will lose every single time as black people are the most loyal to the party. Older people vote more than younger people and so older black people overshadow any of young black people who vote more progressive simply because young voters don’t show up.

Basically this is my mini rant. Because time and time again I see the same argue with the Bernie bros that keep saying that black people are misinformed and voting against their own best interests simply because they don’t like Bernie, a older white guy who comes from a very white state and only led at first people the first few states that start the democrat primaries also happens to have a very white population. Universal doesn’t work all the time, as a politician it’s better to aim at helping individuals and make the current system better, because not everyone wants a revolution.",1,0.129,0.76,0.111,-0.9673

Putting the onus on the accused to defend themselves is wrong, even if it is done in the vain of “fighting the patriarchy”. Sexual violence is no doubt a huge problem on college campuses, but reinstating Obama’s policy on this seems like a mistake to me. I hope Biden reconsiders his position on this.

&amp;#x200B;

OBLIGATORY BASHAR AL-ASSAD INFO:

Bashar al-Assad first became president of Syria when, after his father and previous president died, Bashar was picked by parliament as a candidate after the constitution was amended to lower the minimum age from 40 to 34, Bashar's age. In the ensuing 2000 presidential election 99.7% of Syrians voted in favor of having Bashar al-Assad as president. He won reelection by a similar margin in 2007, facing his first ""real"" election in 2014 where he won 88.7% of the vote, beating out the second place candidate by 84.4 points, though this second reelection has been deemed by many as illegitimate. A member of the Ba'ath Party, which has the tenants of pan-Arabism, Arab nationalism, Arab socialism, secularism, anti-imperialism and anti-Zionism. In response to the Damascus Spring he shut down the Mezzeh prison and mass amnesty for members of the Muslim Brotherhood, though began security crackdowns shortly afterwards. After the War on Terror began al-Assad sided with the west and turned Syria into a major site of extraordinary rendition, with al-Qaeda suspects being interrogated in Syrian prisons. Despite this al-Assad heavily criticized the US, Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia, showing an affinity for Iran. In 2005 al-Assad faced accusations from the international community that Syria, and in extension him, was responsible for the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri owing to the strained relationship between al-Assad and Hariri. By far the biggest event in al-Assad's presidency has been the Syrian Civil War. The chain of events begun with mass protests calling for political reforms, civil rights and ending the state of emergency which had been emplaced since 1963. Despite promises of national dialogue of reform and in 2012 a referendum to draft a new constitution passed with 90% support, though it was denounced as meaningless by many other countries. By July the Red Cross declared Syria to be in a state of war as violence continued to balloon. In 2014 Assad faced much internal criticism and pressure after the loss of four military bases in Raqqa and the ISIL capture of the Tabqa Airbase and massacre of much of its garrison. In 2015 many members of al-Assads family were mysteriously killed or imprisoned as it looked increasingly likely the government would lose the civil war. However, the war turned around with the direct involvement of Russia, and ever since al-Assad has grown close with Putin. The success of the government was guaranteed when Aleppo was retaken in 2016. In 2017 al-Assad faced accusations of using chemical weapons against Syrian civilians at multiple times. In the same year al-Assad joined the Paris Climate Agreement. While there is much more that could be discussed about his policies and relations, to keep this blurb short I am going to end it here.

380,"I have finally come around to the arguments against student loan forgiveness One of the issues that I never seemed to agree with this sub on was student loan forgiveness. And it was because it would benefit me greatly but I tried to find other ways to rationalize it. I really thought about it and crunched some numbers and I understand why many on this sub are opposed to this policy. First, I understand that it’s not fair to people with other types of debt (mortgage, medical, credit card, etc.). Second, it’s not fair to those that didn’t go to college or worked tough jobs in college to pay tuition.

Because this post uses numbers that are personal to me, I’m including some background. I graduated last year with an absurd amount of debt (well into six figures). Honestly, I don’t know how it happened because I went to an in state school and graduated in 4 years. I studied Computer Science and got a software job in the defense industry making $70K per year (the average for my major at my school was $77K). I had internships but my GPA was pretty average for my major (3.12) and I was just ok at interviewing. I did well but I was certainly no All-Star.

I crunched some basic numbers and the results were interesting. I took my post-tax post-deductions income and subtracted what I’m currently paying on my private loans with a 15 year repayment plan. Then I estimated what my pre-tax income would be using that number. I found out that **I have the same purchasing power as someone making $52K with no student loan debt**. And this is my first job with no raises or promotions so far. And I live in a suburban/rural area in the Mid Atlantic to give you an idea of COL. Because my federal loans are in extended forbearance, I did not factor those payments in, but I can promise that they would not change things heavily.

Essentially, even with my crazy debt, I still have much higher purchasing power than the average American. And while I would benefit from any forgiveness that Biden would pursue, I no longer support it especially when so many in this country are struggling simply to get back to normal life.",1,0.096,0.793,0.11,0.782

For a subreddit that insisted throughout the election that you truly believed in minority voices, a lot of you are insanely dismissive of criticisms coming from said minorities.

One thing I've noticed about blindness to bigotry is that there is often an excuse for the moment. ""A reasonable chalk up."" 

*The promotion was lost to her pregnancy.*

*The officer feared for his life.* 

*Well, she shouldn't be forced to make the cake.* 

*They should have come here the right way.*  

In these reasonable chalk-ups there is no room for patters to be looked at and no room for the role of any bigotry no matter how small or great it may be. Instead, there is this annoyance that such an issue would be brought up so ""frivolously"" often by minorities or activists. And it is used as a cudgel towards future attempts to bring it to light. This is speaking in broad terms of course.

In this sub, I see it being channeled into complaints of ""wokeism"" or whatever. Complaints of BIPOC as a stupid term (and ignoring who uses it I guess.) *Constant* complaints of Latinx. Giving Macron and his ""Islamism"" the longest fucking leash..."" Lately, the growth in AAPI- targeted hate and violence seemed to spawn this weird gotcha-attempts towards ""wokeist"" activist not wanting to talk about the real elephant in the room: black people apparently.  A conversation that should have been dominated by trying to understand the causes of the swell (yes BIPOC racism included) or potential solutions to the problem became a thread about SJWs to sensitive to say black people and Korean rooftoping.

As for Joe Manchin: Here we have a relatively moderate white man confirm a Kebbler demon who called the NAACP “un-American” and “communist-inspired and who later went on to jail brown toddlers he kidnapped from their parents. But at least it was bipartisan right? Meanwhile, mean tweets are bad and she should convince the neo-confederate party that let off an insurrectionist to vote for her. Well, the White House is a place of Decorum! She needs a more professional background! She's not entitled to the job! Joe ran on uNiTy and Neera is so very clearly dEcIsIvE!!!1!!11!!

Is Joe Manchin integral to the Democratic majority in the Senate rn? Yes. Is he from an R-40 state and needs to reflect the interests of said constituents? Yes. Is he just probably more conservative than most Dems? Yes. Has he voted with the Democrats when it really, really counts? Also yes.

But that doesn't mean he can't be criticized for enabling Republican racism and sexism. The number of people on the subreddit who give white men the benefit of the doubt despite repeatedly showing themselves is incredibly frustrating. From Reagan to Romney, Bush, to Mattis, to fucking McConnell of all people, there is this pattern of doing one good thing and their leash gets lengthened. 

Meanwhile, AOC (who I often disagree with mind you) does regular charity drives, has voted and supported most of Biden's agenda, endorsed Biden, and is at *least* reliably blue, never gets the same hordes of defenders who pull out Manchin's ACA vote every time he says or does something shitty.

This sub recognizes that universal disarmament in terms of campaign funding or even gerrymandering for some of you is stupid. But why is it that the GOP members can threaten their colleagues, endorse a president who has ruined discourse in America, and still get the support of one of our own? Why is it that the brunt of Machin's skepticism and the onus of bipartisanship falls more on the non-white nominees, particularly when the other half is straight-up full of white nationalists?

As a queer black woman and a DACA recipient, AOC's tweet was a solid callout. And the kind of callout, I'd like to hear a bit more of. The consequences of say, demanding bipartisanship from an increasingly ethno-nationalist GOP *just happen* to appear to disproportionately fall on the poor, on immigrants, and on racial and gender/sexual minorities. Or perhaps voting for a hysterically sobbing alleged rapist who is peddling in Clinton conspiracy theories and loving beer may, ya know? *Feel* sexist? To enable and empower a racist that was a known factor at the time while castigating a woman of color for her conduct is something too many people in this overwhelmingly white and male sub seem to defend with: ""but she should have acted better."" 

Unlike Berniebros and Sanders's unusually vitriolic reaction to women who challenged him, we need to call out patterns of this shit. Going after Kamala Harris for not personally consulting you before appearing in your state as if pressure campaigns aren't a fucking thing is absurd. Defending the filibuster, historically used to obfuscate any threat to the levers of white supremacy is absurd. And having a weird pattern of being more skeptical of the minority nominees is a little absurd.  

Now every-time Joe does one of these things, there is often a response here that amounts to: Trust the plan/4d chess/reelection prospects (like Tester doesn't exist.) We should absolutely reaffirm the benefits Manchin brings and understand the limitations that he has as a red-state Dem (potentially up for re-election). There are complaints from him that I don't agree with but make sense in the context of his constituents and who he needs to convince. But there are also troubling signs when it comes to Democratic women who are more outspoken about women's rights issues and challenges facing minorities. 

TLDR: Should Neera have avoided 2 am Twitter fights? Yes? But is Manchin enabling Republican racism here? Also yes. Both can be true.",1,0.142,0.755,0.102,-0.9939

**Exclusive: How Obama went to bat for Warren**

&gt;	It was a ninety percent Warren sermon,” said one donor in the room. When he was asked to return to the original question on his advice, Obama said he liked Buttigieg, a rising talent who’d worked on his own campaign. But despite his affinity for the South Bend mayor, he rattled off a list of reasons why Buttigieg couldn’t win.

&gt;	He’s thirty- eight,” Obama said, pausing for dramatic effect, “but he looks thirty.” The audience laughed. Obama was on a roll, using the tone of light ridicule he some-times pointed at himself— “ big ears” and “a funny name,” he’d said so many times before. Now, it was directed at Buttigieg. “He’s the mayor of a small town,” the former president continued. “He’s gay,” Obama said, “and he’s short.” More laughter

&gt;	Only months earlier, Buttigieg had sat in Obama’s postpresidential office in Washington seeking counsel on how to maintain equanimity in the face of homophobia on the campaign trail. Now, behind his back, Obama was riffing on him to some of the wealthiest Black men in America at a time when Buttigieg had been dubbed “Mayo Pete” by critics who believed he couldn’t connect with African American voters.

&gt;	Obama kept going, acknowledging that he knew Kamala Harris but offering no further commentary. But when he wrapped up, he had left someone out. “You forgot Biden,” one executive said, reminding him of his two- term vice president.

&gt;	Obama seemed apprehensive, according to a source in the room. “His support for Biden was tepid at best,” the person said. At that point, it didn’t matter what he said about Biden. His silence spoke for him.",1,0.04,0.856,0.105,0.9692

458,"Elizabeth Warren is a populist Elizabeth Warren receives quite a lot of leeway on this sub, with her contributions post-GFC being a big reason why. However, much of her time since them has been spent advocating for Bernie sanders-usque populist policy. With this post, I aim to lay out my view that Warren is a populist, who has advocated for some good policy in the past rather than a pragmatist, who supports some populist measures.


**1.  Warren and Sanders platforms are almost identical.**

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders.html

Interestingly - Sanders even comes off as less divisive in some of his policy standpoints like not wanting to throw out the filibuster.

The main difference between their platform's is to whom and how they are being marketed. Elizabeth Warren uses her background as a Professor, reputation as a policy wonk from the reforms post-GFC to appeal to a more educated, wealthier audience. Bernie markets to a less educated, poorer audience. Fivethirtyeight does a good job summarizing this:

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-sanders-vs-warren-battle-is-really-about/

For me, Warren's populism comes off as more opportunistic. Bernie is an ideologue, who has had these views for decades. Warren should know better.

**2.  Addressing -  ""Warren's Medicare for all plan was more reasonable, actually tried to pay for itself""**

Warren's plan paid for itself with a greatest hits of terrible economic policy including:

* Wealth Tax
* Financial Transactions Tax
* Taxing unrealized capital gains
* Removing the ability for companies to deduct durable goods investment

These policies are a nasty combination of terribly inefficient (Wealth Tax) and outright damaging (Transactions Tax, taxing unrealized gains, investment deductions). 

I think the problems with a Wealth tax are well understood on this sub, the financial transactions tax is similarly damaging. I have copied a previous comment that I have written on this, and a Brookings link (International experience section is probably most relevant)

&gt; Dems pushing a Financial transaction tax again. In my opinion, these taxes will be extremely harmful in the long-run, possibly damaging enough to reduce the dollar's effectiveness as a reserve currency. Below is a simple example as to how this could be very damaging.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider a Dealer making a market in a 3.5 month FX trade. If the trade is dealt, the Dealer likely charges .01% or less in bid/offer. In order to hedge the trade, maybe the dealer first hedges to 3 months first, then work out of the difference between 3 months and 3.5 months.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a very common example of a dealer providing liquidity to the market - with the democrats proposal the dealer would be taxed .1% on both the 3m and the 3.5m trade. Then there would likely be one or more trades to hedge the difference, upping the total to .3% charge at least. That is 30 times what a dealer would generally make on a trade. These charges 100% will be passed onto a client.

https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/what-is-a-financial-transaction-tax-2/

**3.  Addressing Warrens record on financial regulation**

Warren certainly is the Democrat's leading voice on financial regulation, but I think it would be better to rephrase that as ""Warren is the Democrat's leading advocate for more financial regulation, consumer advocacy."". Banking underwent what is probably the largest regulatory expansion ever post the GFC. Unequivocally - the regulatory expansion was warranted, and the post-GFC regime of expanded liquidity, capital, too-big-to-fail regulations have strengthened the financial system. The CFPB is a non-inconsequential part of that reform and has become a useful tool for consumers to get better treatment from banks.

However, regulation is not without costs. Common sense would dictate that after any massive regulatory expansion, there are likely some aspects that need to be tuned, calibrated or rolled back. Recently, several of the worst aspects of the regulation has become strained by the Fed's extraordinary actions this year. Much of these issues have been the focus of bank lobbying for years, but the stress has highlighted this to non-partisan policy institutions as well. The worst offenders are likely.

* The calibration of SLR

https://www.brookings.edu/research/enhancing-liquidity-of-the-u-s-treasury-market-under-stress/

* The calibration of GSIB/Stress testing

https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/03/20/the-fed-should-clarify-how-banks-can-deploy-capital-and-liquidity/


In their current state, these regulations are damaging the safety and soundness of the financial system and are in desperate need of some fine tuning. GSIB is a particularly bad offender in my opinion and has had the exact opposite effect of its intent (reducing competition for large banks). This is the perfect opportunity for a left-leaning politician to show that they are pragmatic, willing to work to make a safer financial system. What has been the Warren's response? She has continued to advocate for the damaging policies. 

https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-and-brown-to-regulators-it-would-be-a-grave-error-to-extend-capital-exemptions-for-the-nations-large-banks-and-holding-companies

During the past 10 years, increasing financial regulation has become Warren's brand -  politically she is either unwilling or unable to do anything but advocate for increasing regulation. Harmful regulation could cause the financial system to be more unstable, increase the cost of products that consumers use. Resulting adverse financial conditions can easily impact the economy as a whole, increased interest rate volatility directly impacts mortgage rates. The impacts of the policies are nuanced, perfect for a ""policy wonk"" to address, but generally Warren has decided to broadly dismiss any efforts to deregulate banking.

**Conclusion**

All-in-all, Warren is running a populist agenda, using her background as a Harvard professor/Financial policy wonk to appeal to more educated Democratic voters. Her policies seem more reasonable at first glance - like her MFA proposal, but, in reality, the details are much more damning. Finally, Warren isn't as much of a financial policy wonk - but more of an informed advocate for bank regulation. Warren is closer to a Bernie than a Biden, and this subreddit should start treating her as such.",1,0.079,0.834,0.087,0.6632

&amp;#x200B;

OBLIGATORY BENJAMIN NETANYAHU INFO:

Benjamin Netanyahu first became Prime Minister of Israel in 1996 when he won the general election by a slim 50.5%, with his second place opponent getting 49.5%. He later lost reelection in 1999, though in the wake of the 2009 Knesset election he was able to form a majority and maintain power ever since. Netanyahu is a member of Likud, a center-right to right-wing party which has the tenets of national liberalism, economic liberalism, conservatism, Zionism and right-wing populism. In his first term he raised many questions about the Oslo Accords, criticizing the idea that the negotiations with peace with Palestine should happen in stages and with concessions. In tandem with the mayor of Jerusalem, in 1996 Netanyahu opened up an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel, which spared three days of riots that saw dozens of Palestinians and Israelis killed. Simultaneously talks were had with the Palestinian Authority, culminating in the Hebron Protocol in 1997 and Wye River Memorandum in 1998, though both were not fully conducted. Just three years after establishing peace with Jordan Netanyahu ordered the assassination of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in Jordan via poison. The plot failed, forcing Netanyahu to give the antidote, being pressured into releasing 61 prisoners and crashing Israel-Jordanian relations. Domestically he guided Israel towards a free-market economy, selling government shares in banks and state-run companies, and easing Israel's foreign exchange controls. He also faced a myriad of scandals relating to corruption and his marriage, directly contributing to him losing power in 1999. After returning to power in 2009 he issued his beliefs on what would bring about Israeli approval of a Palestinian state, namely its total demilitarization, all of Jerusalem serving as Israel's capital, Palestinians giving up their ""right to return"" policy and support for Israeli settlements in the West Bank. He did lift checkpoints in the West Bank, which allowed some economic growth in the area. In late 2009 Netanyahu issued a 10-month freeze on construction of new settlements, though construction proceeded anyways and the freeze did little to encourage peace talks. In 2010 he approved of new apartments in northeast Jerusalem and approved of new settlement construction after the freeze ended, torpedoing peace talks which were held simultaneously. In 2011 protests broke out across Israel decrying the high standards of living, leading Netanyahu to form the Trajtenberg Committee and the eventual adoption of reforms they recommended. In 2013 he approved economic measures to increase competition and privatize Israel's ports. After the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in 2014 Netanyahu approved military strikes into Gaza, with the Palestinians reciprocating with missile strikes, culminating in the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza, lasting over a month and seeing thousands killed and wounded. As relations with the US reached an all time low, Netanyahu approved a privatization plan to reduce corruption and polarization in government companies. In 2015 he approved agricultural reforms and lower import duties to lower food prices, deregulation of the approval process in construction, and further reforms in the finance sector, though the government later had to retract some agricultural reforms to get the plan approved. Later that year he drew much ire and controversy when he stated that Mohammed al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem during WWII, gave the idea of the Holocaust to Adolf Hitler. In 2016 the US allowed UN Resolution 2334 to pass which condemned Israeli settlements, with Netanyahu strongly criticizing the US and withdrawing its annual dues for the UN. In 2017 he withdrew from UNESCO after accusing it as having an anti-Israel agenda. In 2018 the Nation-State Bill, supported by Netanyahu's government, passed, stating that Israel is a nation-state for the Jewish people. During the Coronavirus pandemic Netanyahu has focused on vaccinating the people of Israel with tremendous success, though has received ire for not helping Palestine. Beginning in 2017 Netanyahu came under legal trouble with a large scale investigation launched against him involving corruption, being officially charged in January of 2020 and the trial set to begin in May of 2020.

464,"Joe's policy time constraints: What should we do? A successful Biden presidency poses a serious medium- to long-term threat to left politics because if he delivers on enough big-ticket items affecting the middle and working classes- namely, [healthcare](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/), [housing](https://joebiden.com/housing/) and [education](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2021/02/08/will-free-college-become-a-reality-under-biden/?sh=2fc62bd451cb) prices- the supply of people rushing to burn it all down will decrease.

**Therefore, if you are a leftist who has never heard of Ernst Thalmann or voter suppression, it is in your political interests for Joe to fail while you continue building primary voter bases and spreading unrealistic expectations.**  A successful establishment makes more Nevadas difficult and prevents you from winning general elections even if your concentrated efforts take the party infrastructure.  Of course, if you're a right winger, you want to denounce the left wing while nodding and winking at it.  Tucker Carlson and the Republicans are already handing this splitting of the Democrats.  Once you win you can cheat nonstop and Glenn Greenwald will cover for you.  

**My takeaway from this is that Joe only has about one year- up until the 2022 primaries- to ram through his kitchen table agenda.**  If he can't do this, succs will proliferate due to leftist rhetoric and perceived Democratic inefficacy.  Enough succs will exist to oppose establishment candidates and either a) cost them the general by Bernie16ing them or b) win the primaries and then get crushed.  If either happens, the Republicans will end Democratic control of Congress and obstruct everything, which will then be used a sign of liberal inefficacy.  Combined with ever more illegality and voter suppression this would be a death spiral for liberal democracy in the country.

I'm a fan.

&amp;#x200B;

OBLIGATORY BISHER AL-KHASAWNEH INFO:

After the resignation of Omar Razzaz over the failure to contain the coronavirus, King Abdullah II appointed Bisher Al-Khasawneh to the role of premiership with the twin goals of facilitating November 2020 Jordanian elections and combatting the pandemic. The elections were successfully held, though the turnout was historically low with only 30% turnout. In January of 2021 he announced that Jordan would receive 3 million doses of vaccines (1 million from Pfizer and 2 million from the COVAX initiative).

533,"Democratic Strategy for the future with 99% success guarantee - How selfish Californians / New Yorkers stands in (y)our way into a prosperous future Hello dear community, it's me, the Wish equivalent of Nick Silver. As an outsider from US politics I think I can see certain things more clearly so let me give you a strategy that will guarantee success and make the Republican party irrelevant in the future.




I won't bother with sources because you can look them up yourself ([me ](http://imgur.com/gallery/QrzEK6y)) and you can trust me bro. 





First I will admit that I'm didn't invent this strategy, it's inspired by what the [New England Emigrant Aid Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Emigrant_Aid_Company) did back then before the civil war. So here's the plan Jack: 




I have calculated the margins of Bidens victory in California (~6 Millions) and New York (~2 Millions). We can let 1.5 Million of those people remain where they live for emergencies, we can then still take 4.5 Million out of California and 500.000 out of New York where they only stand in our way into a prosperous future. What now you will probably ask yourself? We then have 5 Million Democrat votes that we can transfer to states where they are actually needed. Sure, moving into a new life is hard and stuff but how important are these little inconvieniences in the greater scheme? I doubt that people would think about silly stuff like this when it comes to decide between that and the sacrifice for the greater good. If Joe Rogan can leave California then you can too. What's so great about it anyway? The US has surely very nice places everywhere, don't be a bigot just to stay with some people that probably don't like you anyway. (Hopefully George Soros can give out some incentives when he's done financing Antifa so the decision gets even easier).




So where should those 5 Million votes go?



As many can guess, Texas would be the first objective. Trump won with ~600.000 votes, even if Texas is probably going Blue in the near future anyway, we can't just rely on that, let's slap 1,2 Million of our resources into that bad boy.



We still have 3,8 millions left and I think the next big target is Florida with a ~400.000 loss. What about 800.000 new voters? Didn't thought of that Mr. Michael De Santa right? Next Democratic stronghold saved.




3 million very fine people left. Since we already saved  the two main objectives and I don't have much sympathy for Ohio, we can decide more flexibly about what we do with those and get creative. To assert dominance, I would plan to conquer the Colonel Sanders (or Abe Lincoln) on the map. For that we will need Arkansas (500k), Louisiana (500k), Missouri (300k), Iowa (200k) and Kentucky (700k).




After that, we are already golden. But we can't forget about those narrow margins that Biden had in the Rust Belt and Georgia. If you paid attention, you would realize that we have still 700.000 votes left. Those should be spread over MN (100k), WI (150k), MI (100k), GA (100k) and the remaining 250k on PA just to flex and as a nod to 2020.



If my calculations are correct, that means the EC result will be 411-159. And maybe that'll be the last EC result ever ;) 





Conclusion:


[This ](http://imgur.com/a/1dhbPTJ) is your new election map. This is the future, if a few people would stop being selfish and do what's right, go out and step out of your comfort zone! If you are from New York/California and your immediate reaction to that map is not like [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/og5736J) I'm really disappointed. Your selfishness is preventing us from a great future and I'll never forgive you for that. For everyone else, I'm thanking you for your service. If I could I would move and join the cause but there are other countries needing my help. So Godspeed, do what's best for your country and help us Make Amercia Great Again!",1,0.052,0.767,0.181,0.9983

I’m curious to know what the neo liberal view is on the following topics:

https://inthesetimes.com/article/world-trade-organization-trump-biden-vaccine-apartheid-covid-intellectual-property-patent (Trump blocked ties intellectual property waiver for the COVID vaccine) 

2) Foreign policy 


My own thinking is that the 1st is rent seeking - government has done a lot to subsidize pharma and partnered with pharma to create these vaccines (in some but not all cases) and so the intellectual property waiver for the COVID vaccine is normal.

On the 2nd - I’d assume that neo liberal view is the libertarian view which is a more humble, less militaristic approach to foreign policy.",1,0.013,0.882,0.105,0.8625

[Unaccompanied children crossing the border]
(https://www.axios.com/border-crisis-record-number-migrant-kids-89cd0b23-a588-4f01-9547-d6f04b262542.html) has drastically increased and will continue to do so. This increase began Obama was president and has continued into trump and biden terms.

When people on the lefg decry biden for the ""kids in cages"", what exactly do they mean?

- Is the issue that kids are being detained at all? Do they want the kids to be turned away at the border, or just let in and roam free without any sort of processing or placement?

- Is the issue the conditions of the facilities? If we improve conditions and reduce crowding, is the ""kids in cages"" no longer an issue?

- Or are the kids being detained indefinitely? Or too long?

Its not like we're rounding up kids and imprisoning them, they are voluntarily crossing the border. Of course, they must be dealing with bad enough conditions to be desperate to make this journey. And I want them to be humanely treated and given asylum if we can.

OBLIGATORY MAEEN SAEED INFO:

Since he was sworn in in late 2018 Maeen Saeed has been preoccupied with the Yemeni Civil War which has engulfed his respective nation since 2014. Chosen as prime minister due to the failure of his predecessor, Ahmed Daghir, to prevent the economy from collapsing any further on top of rapid inflation. In relation to the war he concluded a truce in December of 2018 to allow supplies to be moved from Hudaydah to northern Yemen. Saeed has worked often with the Saudis, continuing and strengthen the alliance they have in a bid to win the war. He survived an assassination attempt on December 31st at the Aden International Airport as coronavirus has wreaked havoc on Yemen, though there is little data due to the war.

Currently, the anime is in the year 2021, and it just finished off a previous season.

When Printer Powell first came onto the show I was a bit skeptical of him inheriting Yellen's(later in the list) powers, but during the Pandemic Arc, I was thoroughly surprised by his skill in using the Money Printer Path! I am so excited to see how this character develops in the future and to see if his Low Rates Path Ability works well in the recovery.

This character came onto the scene in a blaze of glory, and his skill and power as displayed in the Anchorage Episode as well as his deep state connections make him potentially one of the strongest characters ever to inherit his State Titan. I am so excited to see how his arc develops, and I think his power is only going to grow from here on.

**8. Janetu Yellen**

She is one of the most highly accomplished econ characters in this show, first then Head of the Council of Economic Sentinels, then became Fed Throne, and now she is the Treasury Titan. When her character was exiled back in year 2018, I cried and cried and cried, and I'm exhilarated to see her character being brought back for Season Biden.

**7. Sir Joseph Manchin III**

Initially, Manchin III was just another Senatorian, however, I must say that after the events of the Runoff Arc his character has developed a lot of crazy new powers. I think all fans of the show can agree we were truly gobsmacked when he pulled out his new Manchin Cycle-Gan in that battle with Miche McTurtell during the Stimulus Arc.

**5/6. Queen Pelosi/Queen Clinton**

Choosing between numbers 6 and 5 was probably the hardest choice I had to make when creating this list, and in the end, I decided not to make the choice as these two queens. 

Queen Pelosi is one of the strongest Speakers in US history and it's easy to see why. She was able to get the ACA-health potion act passed, 2 landmark stimulus bills in 2 separate Economic Earthquakes, among others. In addition to her tenacity and sausage-making power, she was also willing to pay the Midterm Price to help revive Hussein Obama in unlocking the ACA in the Healthcare Arc.

I think Queen Clinton is one of the most tragic characters in this show, and there are quite a lot of tragic characters in this series. She's clearly one of the strongest characters, being tied to the husband of Hillary Clinton, one of the inheritors of the State Titan, as well as the first female White House Candidate. Alas, fate and misfortune would have her be the target of attacks by the villainous GOV(Grand old Villains), and she will never unlock her full potential power. I still cry thinking about that.

**4. Hussein O'bama**

As with Queen Clinton, O'bama was the target of concentrated strikes by the GOV, but against all odds, he was able to prevail, and going back to the section of Pelosi was able to get landmark laws unlocked.  Unfortunately, even though we was able to hold onto the President Stand for the whole two terms, and the GOV attacks did cause a lot of damage, and it's often said in community forums that O'bama could never use his full power.

**3. The Donald**

Urgh, I hate having to put this person on the list but I must in order to accurately assess power levels. I think most fans of the show did underestimate him as the main villain of Season Trump, as he was still able to overcome Queen Clinton, albeit through cheating by using The Rust Strategy. Plus, despite calls to boycott the show over the craziness of the whole thing, his hypnosis abilities over the GOV are still canon, and his showing during the Insurrection Arc is one of the craziest displays of power seen throughout the show.

**2. Joseph Jo Biden**

A flawed man, but without a doubt one of the most well-developed and strongest characters of the whole show. He went from defeating Cornpop to defeating Paul Ryan and finally defeating The Donald. So far during the new season, he has shown a spectacular display of power ramming through his Stimulus Key and unlocking the economic recovery ability. I look forward to seeing how strong he gets in the future, and the hint towards the final Season being about him coming up against this God character makes me giddy. Unfortunately, I cannot rank God in this list as there are no visible displays of his power seen yet in the show

***Honorable Mentions:***

*- Miche McTurtell: Would have easily been top 5 in the list but he has been weakened heavily after the Runoff Arc. Fuck him.*

\- *Chucky Schumer: Would be on the list if it wasn't for Manchin III in all but name usurping his position. If his new plan to use the Reconciliation Weapon multiple times works, it may bump him into the list.*

\- *Pete Buttigieg: Absolutely will be on the list once he shoots down the NIMBY lord and implements High-Speed Rail through the whole Liberu world.*

**1. Bernke Sama**

Despite using only the bottom 1% of his powers throughout the whole show, Bernke is clearly the current strongest character of the show. He was able to save the global economy by being an absolute Chad and using only his beard powers. It was a short fight, but most fans of LIberu agree that his scuffle with Paul the Goldbug was one of the most entertaining fights in anime history, and helps cement Bernke's legacy as the strongest character of Neo No Liberu.",1,0.111,0.763,0.126,0.9569

580,"The failings of Neoliberalism from a leftist perspective pertaining to national issues using the insight of great minds like Marx, DB Dubois, Ryan Knight and more. (1/69) Hi, I've been lurking around here for a long time, and as a firm believer in Marxist-Leninist thought with Mao influence and Allende conjectures, I think it is time I debunk the various myths and policies which pervade this far-right ideology you call neoliberalism. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off, Capitalism is a fascist set of economic beliefs designed solely to extract capital and enslave the working class for an oligarchic-fascist society. According to [this blog by MasterCommunist1921](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), capitalism is quote ""capitalism is a bourgeouis and archaic concept which takes infinite resources and renders them totally finite, leading to massive rates of discrimination whereupon the majority of a given populace are subject hitherto a myriad of existential punishments."" As this passage clearly details, your beliefs in capitalism is fundamentally flawed. In the third chapter of the seminal [Communism: Praxis and Execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), it details in paragraph 42 that, quote, ""Free trade and low corporate taxes are a sign of a pervasive corruption contained within the vessels of the economic officials dictating said policies. These heinous policies are fundamentally against the rights and needs of the working class, and should be dismissed of post haste."" Its all there, the evidence which debunks the fascist economics you people believe, and clearly favors a socialist system which benefits literally everyone with no downsides.

Second off, the leaders and politicians you ""elect"" (Ryan Knight, a true revolutionary hunk of a man, has clearly proven elections to be rigged by the bourgois elite, but that is for a another time) are total fascist persons who have no desire to assist the people. Ernst Thalmann wrote in his [treasured diary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) six days before he died in Dachau that ""the average centrist or moderate is more in line with the policies and rhetoric of the fascist then the socialist. They have deluded themselves into thinking they are helping the people, but in reality are social fascists who support the bourgeois network."" Thalmann in his infinite wisdom has clearly dispelled the myth of the centrist-moderate. The persons you push into power despite the will of the people, who [clearly favor a socialist leader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), are perpetrators and perpetuators of horrific policy and ideology that hurt the working class. Joe Biden is nothing more then a means for the elite like you to continue spilling innocent blood and extract what little wealth the rest of the population has. Neoliberalism, as DB Dubois indicated in his work [American Socialism and the True American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that ""neoliberalism and its supporters are inherently racist, sexist, mysoginistic, blasphemous, neo-corporate fascists."" To put it simply, Joe Biden is a racist, and if it were not for the extensive rigging which occurred, compromise candidate Bernie Sanders would have swept South Carolina, the South, win the primary, beat Donald Trump by double digit margins, take complete control of congress and save this country.

Third off, circumcision is a fundamental right of the person. You'll notice in the online essay ""[Judeo-Bolshevism: Or How I Learned to be Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)"" in subsection 3 the writer details ""Circumcision is based ngl."" That really says it all, which of course as expected the bougeois neoliberals you elitists favor are totally against.

Fourth off, race realism. That was pretty fucked up man.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first part of my comprehensive analysis and destruction of the failed ideology of neoliberalism you all hold dear. I sincerely hope the smart ones here will recognize the truth and join me at r/Marx, r/Communism and r/GenZedong",1,0.107,0.754,0.14,0.9594

[https://2021.liberal.ca/policy/](https://2021.liberal.ca/policy/)

Not an expert on a lot of the topics presented, but this is giving me a really good impression. Anything would, honestly, after seeing what the NDP will be debating for their foreign policy at their convention. That, and what the Conservatives have decided on for climate change action. In any case, genuinely good stuff in here that often gets brought up in this subreddit.

One example of a recent hot topic is a global corporate tax if I understand what Yellen proposed correctly. Page 26 of the longer document of prioritized resolutions includes a call to work with the G20 on implementing something like that from the looks of it. Seems somewhat possible with the current US administration if the Biden administration intends to do more than just float an idea. The next few years will be a good time for some Canadian and American cooperation.

The fast-tracked resolution with the most support is a basic income proposal that builds up from the COVID-19 support systems that had been put in place last year. I think the language here looks promising since it focuses on streamlining existing welfare and reducing bureaucracy.

A proposal for a trans-Canada high-speed rail project is also on the list of fast-tracked resolutions. Honestly, the most I ever hoped for was Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver being tacked onto an American network. Though it would be pretty fantastic if the Liberals ever commit to building a line across the Quebec City-Windsor corridor.

The one thing I'm unsatisfied with is a reluctance to try nuclear in one of the energy resolutions, but the rest has me pretty happy. Some interesting ideas in here too like having some students volunteer in their fields of study to get their student loans forgiven. All the above plus other points like building more housing and diversifying the economy out west means there might be a lot of good to look forward to even if only some of these resolutions manage to get votes.",1,0.016,0.773,0.212,0.998

&amp;#x200B;

OBLIGATORY HAITHAM BIN TARIQ INFO:

Haitham bin Tariq assumed the throne, and premiership, of Oman after his cousin Qaboos bin Said died in January of 2020. After taking power he promised to uphold his predecessor's peace-making foreign policy and to continue building the country's economy.

661,"Fellow gun haters: Please stop pushing the Federal Assault Weapons Ban I'm not a gun enthusiast. I've never owned a gun. I've never touched a gun. I'm *very* scared of guns.

Nonetheless, I oppose the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. I opposed it back when it was still in place. I opposed it when it expired in 2004. I opposed it when Diane Feinstein repeatedly failed to resurrect it over the next decade. I opposed it when Barack Obama made it part of his agenda. I opposed it when nothing became of that. I continue to oppose it now that Biden is urging it to return.

Because I'm a big gun apologist? Because I'm a conservative gun nut? Fuck no. I'm a left-leaning liberal. I'm scared to death of guns. But I believe in legislation that *works* and *makes sense*.

Everyone knows what an assault rifle is. They do not know what an assault ""weapon"" is. I have watched the two get conflated for literally decades now. They don't mean the same thing. ""Assault weapon"" is a toothless political category that was farted up in 1994 so that Congress could do the minimum possible while pretending they actually did something meaningful to tackle gun violence. I continue to boggle that people waste their brains trying to justify that the significant rise in mass shootings over the last fifteen years indicates that banning barrel shrouds and bayonet mounts somehow reduced mass shootings.

The late 90s *did* have fewer mass shootings. They were a peaceful time in a lot of ways. The economy was [booming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_United_States_boom). Shootings were [down](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/21/gun-homicides-steady-after-decline-in-90s-suicide-rate-edges-up/). Property crime was [down](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191237/reported-property-crime-rate-in-the-us-since-1990/). Drug use was [down](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/realitycheck/blog/2014/09/05/2013-national-report-drug-use-and-health). Suicide was [down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_the_United_States). Clinton was having [an affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal). Neocons were [dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century). It was a good time.

In 1999, [two teenagers shot up a high school and killed 15 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre). A lot of people on this subreddit probably weren't even born yet, but I was in middle school when it happened. People were scared. You may not realize it, but that was the first time in US history that students had taken guns to school and carried out a major mass shooting. We blamed Marilyn Manson. We blamed video games. We blamed television. We blamed bullies. We blamed parents. We blamed guns.

We didn't know what went wrong. But whatever it was, [it didn't stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_effect). I became an activist on the subject of violence in schools. I spoke to concerned parents about what was happening every day in the hallways and school yards. But the shootings just kept happening. Taking a gun to school and killing people was part of the cultural vocabulary now, and kids at the brink reached for it. School shootings became the new normal. The idea of armed guards in schools was crazy when I was a kid. Now it's accepted. And it all started while the assault weapons ban was *in place*.

[This is a Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic rifle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushmaster_XM-15) It has the appearance and performance characteristics of an AR-15 rifle. It was used in the [North Hollywood shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout), the [DC sniper attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._sniper_attacks), the [Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting), and the [Nashville Waffle House shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Waffle_House_shooting). It is fully capable of killing large numbers of people in a short amount of time.

It is not an assault weapon, because it doesn't have any of the fairly arbitrary features that were used to define assault weapon. It was, in fact, designed to follow the assault weapons ban. Mass shooters used it during the ban because it was legal. Mass shooters used it after the ban ended because it was just as effective. The ban didn't stop shooters, and it didn't stop gun manufacturers. *It didn't target the things that mattered.*

The 1994 ban limited magazine sizes, which might well have had a real impact. I have seen limited evidence of this, but it is at least a *rational* thing to do if you're wanting to reduce casualties in mass shootings. But the new ""assault weapon"" category of guns wasn't rationally constructed. Many aspects of the definition, like flash suppressors and bayonet stocks, were arbitrary and pointless; others, like the unloaded weight of a handgun, were at most tangential to the things that actually mattered.

But it had damn good marketing. The phrase ""assault weapon"" took on a life of its own. Suddenly everyone thought they knew what it meant. You know, it's obvious. Right? The *really bad* guns. [M16s and shit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle) Even if you know fully automatic rifles were already illegal, you'll hear that semi-auto AR-15s and AK-47s were banned under the law, so you'll think this is just the semi-automatic equivalent of assault rifles. Maybe you hear about *grenade launchers* being in the definition, and think *that* sounds like a good thing, you *can't believe* those were unregulated for so long before this noble law passed. ([They weren't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructive_device))

But it's just not so. Whatever you're inclined to believe an assault weapon is, unless you've actually read the law and seen how pointless it is, you're probably wrong. Because the XM-15 and others like it could sidestep the ban, and they're the same damn thing. The assault weapons ban didn't actually do the job it was meant to do. All it did was annoy gun owners and force manufacturers to *slightly* adapt. The NRA spin of calling the restrictions ""cosmetic"" is not entirely true, because the targeted features do have function... but it may as well be, for as much rational purpose as the restrictions have on actually stopping shooters. It pisses people off on the right precisely because it's so toothless, so empty, that it feels like *nothing* but a pure slap in the face. Just a kick in the nuts for no reason. And so, perhaps more damning than just being bad legislation, it has convinced two generations of gun owners that the left can't be trusted to regulate guns *at all* because they have *no idea* what they're doing.

Trying to study whether the ban had any impact on gun violence or not is like trying to study whether banning [this knife](https://www.knifewarehouse.co.uk/product/7-5-inch-laced-hunting-knife-with-sheath/) but not [that knife](https://www.topsknives.com/operator-7) reduced knife crimes. The entire premise of the law is so pointless and ineffectual that even if knife crimes were down during the law, *the law is almost certainly unrelated*. ""Does passing gas cause hurricanes? Studies show a ban on beans correlated with fewer natural disasters.""

[Mass shootings are up significantly now.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/811487/number-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us/) So is suicide. Both are overwhelmingly not done with assault weapons. Even when they are, that's totally incidental, because there's nothing about assault weapons that makes them any more effective, *or even cosmetically alluring,* for a shooter. ""Military-style"" guns with nearly identical appearance, and *exactly* the same killing power, were still legal in the 90s, because the ban was extremely poorly targeted.

And in case you have any doubt about my motivations, let me be clear. My uncle took his own life just a couple weeks ago. I truly believe that if he didn't have a gun, if it hadn't been so easy, he'd be alive today. Maybe he still would have found a way. But I truly believe he would have come home that night. *I don't like guns.*

I want to do something to reduce gun violence, which is why it pains me to see people focusing on this misguided law. I keep half-expecting someone to use the label of an assault weapons ban but actually revise the definition in a way that will make a real difference. But it keeps not happening. The gun control debate is trapped in the 90s. We're still trying to ban flash suppressors and bayonet mounts and dicker about the shape of the grip.

That wasn't a good answer to gun violence then, and it's not now. I believe in good government, in effective government, in passing laws that matter, and passing laws that work. I believe that arbitrary laws are *bad*. I believe that this law set back gun control severely. I believe that if people were more fluent with guns, only a small fraction of those people would still be discussing this legislation. I believe that instead of wasting our time with this nonsense for the third decade in a row, people interested in *banning something* would be pushing to ban something actually meaningful.

Like certain calibers. Or rate of fire. Or expanding ammunition. Or even *handguns*.

But meaningful is hard, so almost forty years on we're still talking about banning fucking bayonet mounts.

**TL;DR: The Federal Assault Weapons Ban is a toothless cop-out by politicians who couldn't do better. It isn't what you think it is and doesn't do what you want it to do. It angers gun owners not because it cuts deep, but because it cuts arbitrarily and has no rational basis in stopping shootings. ""Assault Weapons"" as defined in the bill are so badly defined that the definition can be and has been trivially sidestepped by manufacturers and mass shooters alike.**",1,0.275,0.651,0.075,-0.9999

680,"Thoughts On Leaving Afghanistan I've seen a number of reactions to the decision to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by September. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I share some of these same sentiments. But it's important that we remember a few things: We will still be providing billions in military and economic aid. We will still be providing intelligence support for the Afghan military. We will still have the capacity to combat terrorist threats from Al-Qaeda, and will be actively monitory for an ISIS-like organization to fill the vacuum we leave behind (although realistically it will be the Taliban). The fall of the Afghan government will most likely not be quick. It will probably just fall deeper into the quagmire of corruption and incompetence it is already in as terrorist attacks continue and the Taliban becomes increasingly brazen, until it eventually collapses or is revitalized some time in the future. I would say that the likelihood of Kabul falling in the near future (6 months to a year) is low, but some kind of large-scale political change, Taliban-caused or not, is inevitable. It may not be what you wanted, but it (probably) won't be as bad as some are saying, at least in the near term.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I most wanted to make this post was to point out the lesson of these event, a lesson that some seem to be missing: Leaving is popular. Very popular. There's a reason Biden and Trump both announced they would leave, and that is that the war in Afghanistan, both as a general idea, but particularly in terms of having boots on the ground, is very unpopular amongst the American people. It is viewed as a waste of time, money, and lives, regardless of its merits. How did this happen? The idea of America having a very large military force, and using it liberally to stop genocides and spread democracy, died in Iraq. It was the ultimate over-reach. An intervention based on a lie, resulting in the loss of countless lives because we didn't know what we were doing.  From an American perspective, the intervention was the cause of mass death, with, quite literally, no good results. Of particular focus here is the media: reports of American casualties are shocking and widely reported. Iraq and Afghanistan are remembered by Americans not because of the money spent there, or even, to be frank, the Iraqis killed by Saddam (how many Americans know or care about the Kurds killed under Saddam?) or the women repressed by the Taliban. They are remembered because Americans died there.

&amp;#x200B;

But I also want to end hopefully. Belief that Iraq was a mistake peaked in '08. Belief that Afghanistan was a mistake peaked in '14. The American people are not ideologically isolationist, it is just a response to a mishandled intervention. Foreign policy was not a top issue in any of the last three elections. The fight against ISIS was seen as a victory. America's anti-terrorist activities in Sub Saharan Africa go unnoticed by most people. America's continued support for North-Eastern Syria is a non-issue. As long as American troops do not die (or kill large numbers of civilians) support for interventions will remain lukewarm.

&amp;#x200B;

This means that going forward the US should be careful about when and where it intervenes. Our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan should be our guideposts on what to avoid: Countries facing contentious internal ethnic or religious splits. Countries that have little central control. Long conflicts or lots of state-building. There are also places we should intervene: An invasion, especially one leading to a genocide or ethnic cleansing. A coup by unpopular security forces. An unpopular dictatorship incompetently governing a well educated and wealthy populace. We should look for international buy-in, but if we believe an intervention to be just, we have to be ready to intervene regardless, and we have to use domestic fighters as much as possible in order to minimize US casualties and keep support high enough. Intervention is not unpopular - incompetent intervention is.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: afghanistan unlikely to fall immediately, US will still provide support support, mostly a media play. Iraq unpopular, but not all interventions or military actions. Have to prioritize in order to ensure domestic popularity of interventions in the future.

Biden seems to understand that the voting public demands to be protected
from terrorist attacks. In his withdrawal announcement, he stated that

&gt; We will not take our eye off the terrorist threat....We will reorganize our counterterrorism capabilities and the substantial assets in the region to prevent re-emergence of terrorist threat to our homeland.

In other words, the US will continue overseas military operations against terrorist groups, because not doing so would likely result in an increase in frequency and significance of terrorist attacks on the US homeland.

Since having all of Afghanistan as a base of operations for al Qaeda and other allied terrorist groups would be the height of “[taking] our eye off the terrorist threat,” this means that the US will continue military operations in Afghanistan, likely even at similar levels to today, just without a deployment of regular troops!

The New York Times reported today that the Pentagon is trying to base troops in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, or Uzbekistan in order to support operations in Afghanistan, which is likely to be much more expensive and less effective basing troops at the current bases in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, Biden is mostly withholding air support from the Afghan government in their fight against the Taliban. If sustained, this policy would most likely lead to the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. If the Taliban become the recognized government of Afghanistan, then operations against al Qaeda would become acts of war against Afghanistan. Furthermore, without allies on the ground such as the current Afghan military, the US would likely be unable to target al Qaeda effectively.

Thus, Biden will either let the government of Afghanistan fall, likely leading to more terrorist attacks on the US homeland in the medium term and a potential political debacle, or, more likely, be forced to resume air support for the Afghan government, or even redeploy troops to Afghanistan.

What is the effect of the withdrawal, then? Most likely, costlier and less effective military operations. And, a large proportion of Afghanistan taken over or consolidated by the Taliban, who will impose harsh authoritarian and misogynistic rule.

(Somehow, when this sub was in a tizzy about the EU possibly curbing exports, we completely missed that the Anglo countries have already been much more egregious in this aspect.)  In addition to limiting exports of finished vaccines, the US is using the Defense Production act to limit exports of *raw materials* used to create vaccines, which has delayed foreign manufacturing [such as in India](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/16/indias-covid-vaccine-maker-urges-biden-to-lift-exports-embargo). These policies were started by Trump but never reversed by Biden.

Yes, the US government spent a lot of money on vaccine development through Operation Warp Speed, and yes, the pandemic situation was bad in January-March, so it was somewhat justified that Americans got higher priority for doses. However, now that the US is way ahead in vaccination while the situation is getting worse in Europe/Canada and disastrous in India, it is becoming immoral to continue limiting exports to such a high degree. Let's stop blocking companies from selling raw materials to India, so they can better combat their virus surge. Let's open trade barriers with Canada instead of just ""lending"" them a few million doses.

729,"Aerial spraying of coca fields in Colombia: an inefficient, costly, and dangerous anti-drug strategy # 1. Introduction

Aerial spraying of illicit crops has been at the core of anti-drug efforts in Colombia since the late 20th century. Despite the suspension of its use in 2015, the current government has expressed intentions of implementing it once again. This has prompted reactions in academia, politics, civil society, and the international community due to significant concerns about its effectiveness and safety. In this post, I argue that this method is ineffective and costly and that it is a threat to human health, communities, and the environment.

# 2. Background

The use of aerial spraying as a method for eliminating illicit crops began in the 80s as a core tactic of Plan Colombia, a US strategy aimed at supporting the Government of Colombia in the fight against drug trafficking. Between 1999 and 2015, the Colombian authorities sprayed more than 1.7 million hectares of coca (Rodríguez, 2020). In 2015, the World Health Organization classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans”, based on research by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Because of this, its use in aerial spraying was suspended in the same year in Colombia by a sentence of the Colombian Constitutional Court. However, the Government of Colombia has [recently moved towards restarting aerial spraying](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2021/04/13/gobierno-de-colombia-busca-reactivar-la-fumigacion-aerea-de-cultivos-ilicitos-con-glifosato/). In addition, the US Department of State included it among the potential strategies for drug control in Colombia (United States Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2021). This motivated academics from Colombia and around the world to publish an open letter for the Biden administration highlighting the dangers of this [endorsement](https://www.eltiempo.com/uploads/files/2021/03/16/Carta-Presidente-Biden-Vicepresidenta-Harris-CESED.pdf).

# 3. Does aerial eradication work?

Aerial eradication is constantly promoted by right-wing Colombian politicians as a key drug control strategy. However, **it does not eliminate illicit crops efficiently, there is a significant risk that short-term results are eroded in the long term by crop replanting, and it does not inflict significant blows to the finances of drug-trafficking groups**. In addition to this, **it requires serious government expenditure**, especially when compared to voluntary crop substitution.

First, research suggests that **aerial eradication has a limited impact on illicit crops**. Estimates of the marginal effect of spraying one hectare on illicit crops range from a reduction of 0.022 hectares (Mejía et al., 2017) to 0.11 hectares (Abadie et al., 2015). The cost of achieving these results is far from negligible. *Spraying* one hectare costs 72 million Colombian pesos (COP), equal to USD 256,240 (Rubiano et al., 2020). Hence, the cost of *eradicating* one hectare is between COP 654.54 million and COP 2,400 million (USD 0.18 million to USD 0.67 million). In comparison, voluntary crop substitution programs cost approximately COP 40 million (USD 11,239) per family. Given that the average plot size of coca-producing families is 0.5 hectares (Garzón &amp; Gelvez, 2018), the cost to eliminate one hectare of coca through voluntary substitution can be just 80 million COP (USD 22,470), a mere 12% of the cost of the most optimistic aerial spraying scenario.

Second, **the limited short-term effects of aerial eradication on coca production are offset by crop replanting**. Aerial spraying is not a one-off cost that the government faces to permanently eradicate coca fields since replanting erodes the short-term results. Part of the impact is short-lived since there is a probability of 36% of farmers replanting the crops. In comparison, voluntary crop substitution only has a probability of 0.4% of farmers returning to coca production (Rubiano et al., 2020). Also, forced eradication causes a *balloon effect*, i.e., the relocation of illicit crops to adjacent territories. This mitigates the shock to the supply of coca leaves and leads to multiple social and environmental effects (more on this later) (Rincón-Ruiz &amp; Kallis, 2013).

Third, **even if aerial eradication were effective in destroying illicit crops, it targets a small link in the cocaine supply chain**. The goal of anti-drug operations is to affect cocaine production, reduce supply, and inflict financial damage to cartels and armed groups. Hence, it should target the steps of drug production and commercialization where the biggest share of added value resides. Aerial eradication fails to do so. The production of coca leaves, targeted by these operations, represents 9% of the added value, only second to coca paste production (5%). Transforming coca paste into cocaine has a low share of the value add as well (15%). The whole manufacturing process is overshadowed by trafficking, where a whopping 71% of the value is created (Mejía and Rico, 2010).

# 4. Collateral damage

Even if aerial spraying is relatively ineffective and expensive, it could be argued that such a strategy could have a place in the government’s anti-drug toolbox in case better options fail. However, **the use of aerial eradication is associated with significant negative effects on human health, socioeconomic consequences, and environmental damage**, putting into question said possibility.

# 4.1. Human health

Glyphosate is the main ingredient of the herbicides commonly used for aerial spraying. Hence, this substance is at the center of discussions about the effect on human health of aerial spraying. Reports published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the European Food Safety Authority found no adverse health effects of pure glyphosate. However, **glyphosate-based herbicides employed in aerial eradication are not**. Glyphosate is never used in agriculture and aerial eradication by itself. Herbicide producers combine it with substances that allow it to penetrate plants and act effectively, called *adjuvants*; Roundup, for instance, is a popular commercial formulation that contains glyphosate and adjuvants. Research does suggest that these combinations pose serious threats to human health. Multiple adjuvants (such as Roundup’s POEA, Cosmo-flux 411F, and N-nitroso Glyphosate) are associated with central nervous system, respiratory and gastrointestinal afflictions, and cancer (Rubiano et al., 2020). Furthermore, AMPA, one of glyphosate’s primary degradation products in herbicides, accumulates in the environment over time. This can lead to high exposure rates, associated with negative effects on human health (Stur et al., 2019).

**Several affectations to human health have been identified in people exposed to glyphosate-based herbicides in agriculture**, which use a third of the concentration used in aerial eradication. These include a higher likelihood of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, increased child mortality at birth in populations that live downstream of the sprayed area, and multiple reproductive health affectations, such as miscarriages, premature births, congenital malformations, and reduced fertility (including in later generations) (Ordóñez et al, 2020). In addition, exposure to aerial spraying in Colombia is linked to more medical consultations related to dermatological and respiratory illnesses, and a higher number of miscarriages (Camacho &amp; Mejía, 2017).

## 4.2. Socioeconomic effects

**Aerial eradication operations can intensify violence in the sprayed territories in the short term** thanks to two factors (Abadie et al. 2015). First, the government must deploy military forces in the targeted territory before implementing aerial spraying. Their role is to suppress local armed forces so fumigation can be performed safely from a low altitude since spraying aircraft are vulnerable to anti-air weapons and gunfire. Spraying from higher altitudes would entail the risk that the herbicide is blown off-target by the wind. These pre-spraying operations have led to a higher number of combatant casualties during the month before the spraying. Second, civilian casualties in territories where aerial spraying was implemented by 22.8%.

These consequences can be attributed to Kalyvas’ selective violence theory (Kalvyas, 2006): non-state actors employ selective violence to disincentivize defection and collaboration with the opposing group. Territories become contested due to troop deployment and eradication operations. In addition, the interaction between the government and coca farmers increases during these deployments. In response to this, **armed groups use selective violence to deter locals from collaborating with the government and to punish them if they are suspected of already having collaborated with it**. This is consistent with the ties between anti-drug enforcement and violence identified in the US (Miron, 1999), Mexico (Dell, 2015), and Afghanistan (Clemens, 2013).

Increased violence and health affectations are not the only negative effects of aerial spraying on farmers’ lives. Rural families often resort to coca production because it is the only viable option they have in remote areas of the country, where infrastructure, public goods provision, security, and government presence are scarce (Zuleta, 2017). **Spraying operations threaten their livelihoods, forcing them to explore alternatives for mitigating this shock**. For instance, aerial eradication is associated with an increased probability of children working and falling behind in their education, and a lower likelihood of them attending school (Rodriguez). In addition, the balloon effect implies that vulnerable families are being displaced to other territories, which can lead to clashes between communities (Rubiano et al., 2020). Beyond the impact on the people’s lives, **these consequences delegitimize the State and reduce the communities’ trust in institutions** (Zuleta, 2017).

## 4.3. Environmental damage

The environment can also suffer the consequences of aerial spraying. **Direct effects include the spreading of substances that are toxic to amphibians and fishes and the destruction of natural habitats**. Glyphosate-based herbicides contaminate water sources. This, in turn, leads to deformities and organ disfunction in amphibians, and increases their toxicity, putting at risk the species that feed on them. Research also suggests that these herbicides affect the motor functions, memory, and early morphological development of some fish species, and can even be lethal. Last, these substances can severely damage the breeding habitats of migratory species. **These direct effects can cause unbalances in the local ecosystem and ripple effects, such as plagues** (Rubiano et al., 2020).

The balloon effect can also endanger local ecosystems and natural reserves. Displaced families can push the agricultural frontier when looking for new lands for producing illicit crops. **This causes deforestation and disrupts key local ecosystems, such as those protected in natural reserves** (Rubiano et al., 2020). In fact, 47% of coca-growing territories are already in protected areas, and illicit crops have increased near national parks, putting local fauna and flora at significant risk (UNODC, 2020).

# 5. Conclusion and alternatives

The previous sections show that **aerial eradication has anemic and short-lived direct effects on illicit crops, implies high costs, and generates important negative collateral effects on health, communities, and the environment**. These implications are well documented, and aerial spraying is not the only anti-drug tool that the Government of Colombia has at its disposal. Its push for resuming this practice, then, looks more like signaling a strong stance against drugs and displaying a short-term impact than achieving lasting results. Better results could be achieved in the medium to long term if the funding used by the Government of Colombia and provided by allies, like the US, were used for other approaches with better changes of crippling the finances of cartels and armed groups. Furthermore, **communities and territories involved in these activities would be far better off**.

To conclude, I briefly present four alternative approaches below: investing in economic development, promoting land formalization and access to land, implementing voluntary crop substitution programs, and providing payments for ecosystem services. Note that this assumes that reducing the production of coca leaves is a good anti-drug policy goal compared to tackling other links in the cocaine production chain; as shown earlier, this is a questionable assumption. However, **these alternatives can improve the livelihoods of rural communities**, so they are worth being considered by policymakers if reducing coca leaves supply is still part of their agenda.

1. *Economic development*. As explained in the previous sections, families often resort to producing coca because it is the most profitable economic activity in remote and poor areas of the country. Implementing policies conducive to local development and improving security and government presence can alleviate this situation. In fact, 170 municipalities with low development levels and affected by violence are being targeted through post-conflict development plans (Programas de Desarrollo con Enfoque Territorial, PDET), although [the government has been dragging its feet in their implementation](https://www.juanitaenelcongreso.com/post/sexto-informe-de-seguimiento-a-la-implementacion-del-acuerdo-de-paz).
2. *Land formalization and access to land*. Land ownership disincentivizes the production of coca by increasing the risks associated with it since landowners can lose properties that have been found with illicit crops in them. In addition, property rights and access to land promote local economic development and investment (Garzón &amp; Riveros, 2018), reducing the likelihood of families having to resort to coca production.
3. *Voluntary crop substitution*. The Colombian National Integral Plan for the Substitution of Illicit Crops (PNIS, in Spanish) aims to promote voluntary crop substitution of illicit crops by providing economic support to rural families whose livelihoods depend on producing coca. As previously mentioned, voluntary crop substitution costs approximately 40 million (USD 11,239) per family and has a replanting probability of 0.4%, making it an attractive alternative to forced eradication.
4. *Payments for ecosystem services*. These payments reward farmers for the provision of ecological services in their territories (Rubiano et al., 2020). Like voluntary crop substitution, they aim to give families an alternative source of income to illicit crops. In addition, it can contribute to the preservation of nature reserves since a significant share of illicit crops are located near protected areas (UNOCD, 2020).

1. I actually give trump credit for negotiating with the Taliban  
2. The deal we signed is terrible. It gave a withdrawal deadline with squishy ass conditions. It had all the same problems of when Obama put a ""time horizon"" on the war so the Taliban could just wait us out  
3. Biden was put between a rock and a hard place by being given a may 1 deadline to withdraw. Do you honor the deal and abandon the Afghan government without a comprehensive peace deal? Or do you break you deal with the taliban with no real way forward?  
4. The decision to stay past may 1 but leave anyway is the worst of both worlds. We both demonstrate that we're not upholding our deal with the Taliban but still abandon the afghan government  
5. Leaving is probably the right call at this point because once we signed the dumbass version of a deal with the Taliban we were kinda screwed into this path. That said, we're doing probably the smart thing in probably the dumbest way we could  


P.S. nobody ever talks about the fact that Afghanistan borders Iran China and basically Russia (the central Asian states are just ornamental), not to mention a semi-unreliable nuclear power and Chinese buddy in Pakistan. Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to have a presence there due to geographic advantages it presents. We have a good chunk of middle eastern bases for Iran but being able to counter Iran from the east and China from the west would be nice. On the other hand, chaos on the border of Iran China and Russia is at least some kind of consolation prize ",1,0.153,0.749,0.098,-0.9613

 * prohibited discipline or discrimination based on a student’s race or culture because of a hairstyle or headdress

Besides being Democratic senators from fairly red states, I realized that Joe Manchin, Jon Tester, and Sherrod Brown have something else in common: all of them are Class 1 senators.

*For those of you who need a quick high school civics refresher, senators serve 6-year terms, but federal elections are every two years. So, only 1/3 of the seats are contested at a time. And since different senators face election at different times, they can also face quite different national environments.*

Consider the recent election years for Class 1 senators:

* **2018** \- Trump midterm, national environment Dem +8
* **2012** \- Obama re-election, national environment Dem +2
* **2006** \- Bush 2nd midterm, national environment Dem +8

Class 1 Dems have had national environment tailwinds for three consecutive elections. But what about their Class 1 and 2 counterparts?

&amp;#x200B;

Class 2:

* **2020** \- Biden election, national environment Dem +4
* **2014** \- Obama 2nd midterm, national environment GOP +6
* **2008** \- Obama 1st election, national environment Dem +9

Class 3:

* **2016** \- Trump election, national environment Dem +1
* **2010** \- Obama 1st midterm (the ""shellacking""), national environment GOP +7
* **2004** \- Bush re-election, national environment GOP +2.5

As you can see, Class 2 Dems have had a bit rougher time of it lately and Class 3 Dems must feel like they built their houses on Indian burial mounds.

The proposal would raise \~$370BN over the next decade and would be used to fund the American Families Plan, which includes spending on children and education.

On one hand, it's refreshing to see politicians finally acknowledge that real wealth is not earned from labor (wages), but rather from capital and investments. On the other, hand 43.4% seems...excessive. When combined with SALT taxes, the upper rate could top out at 52% for New Yorkers and 57% for Californians, per Bloomberg.

For Earth Day this year, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, the ranking Republicans on several House committees, and a number of Republicans in Congress rolled out a set of climate policy proposals that they branded as the Republican response to the Green New Deal. I’ve been observing the emergence of climate-oriented Republicans over the past few years, so I thought I would offer an update on what the GOP’s climate policy looks like for anyone who is interested. So today, we’re talking about the **[Energy Innovation Agenda](https://www.republicanleader.gov/the-energy-innovation-agenda/)**.

I’ve been burned on this before. Last summer, I wrote a pretty long post on this sub about a different “comprehensive plan” that Republican leaders endorsed and then immediately backtracked. You can read my post about that [here](/r/neoliberal/comments/hkmd2f/the_house_republicans_and_democrats_both_just/). 

# The Energy Innovation Agenda

The Republicans call their plan the “Energy Innovation Agenda.” The EIA was not created as a unified proposal, but rather drawn from many pre-existing bills introduced by Republicans. Among the notable members participating in the rollout this week were:

- **Kevin McCarthy**, GOP leader 
- **Garret Graves**, the top Republican on the **Select Committee on the Climate Crisis**
- **Cathy McMorris Rodgers**, top Republican on the **Energy and Commerce** Committee
- **Bruce Westerman**, top Republican on the **Natural Resources** Committee
- **Frank Lucas**, top Republican on the **Science, Space, and Technology** Committee
- **Sam Graves**, top Republican on the **Transportation and Instructure** Committee
- **Glenn Thompson**, top Republican on the **Agriculture** Committee
- **Michael McCaul**, top Republican on the **Foreign Affairs** Committee
- **Gary Palmer**, Chair of the **House Republican Policy Committee**

There were also plenty of Republican House members supporting the rollout without any relevant leadership position. But given the strong leadership support for the EIA, I am comfortable calling it the Republican plan.

# Composition of the Agenda

The webpage and rollout for the Agenda were built around the following six pillars. The bolded here text is taken from the plan itself, and the unbolded is my short summary. 

-  **Technological Innovation** Anticipating new technologies is the keystone of the GOP Agenda
- **Nuclear Energy** Policy to boost US uranium supply and finance nuclear plants in other countries
- **Natural Gas/Pipelines** We need more of it, including American gas exports to other countries
- **Renewable Energy** Lots of hydropower, plus mining of critical minerals
- **Regulatory Reform** Remove regulatory barriers to energy projects, especially natural gas drilling and pipelines
- **Natural Solutions and Conservation** Forestry and farming to sequester carbon

For the rest of the post, I will go through each plank of this agenda discussing those proposals and my own analysis of them.

# Technological Innovation

This plank does not refer to any one technology in particular, with the other sections all dedicated to individual tech areas. Rather, this plank outlines the general Republican outlook that **further technological innovation is the key to addressing climate change**.

Now, literally everyone in the climate policy space also recognizes an important role for technological progress. I’m a techno-optimist. What is unique about this GOP approach, though, is that it seeks to **preserve existing practices rather than enabling new ones**. Both Republicans and Democrats are responding to the same observed problem: our economy is based on production methods that emit greenhouse gases.

 Democrats respond to this by trying to change the economy so that it is no longer based on those production methods. They seek to alter price structures and create incentives to push people away from these destructive systems, before imposing regulations to end them entirely. Their end goal is to run the whole economy on zero-carbon energy.

**Republicans, on the other hand, want to modify the existing production methods so that we can continue relying on them without harming the climate.** The Republican plan has no intention of eliminating fossil fuels, reducing automobile use, or decreasing energy consumption. Instead, it hopes to discover technological and natural solutions that will let these practices remain, just minus their intense carbon emissions. And, as I will discuss, it is not clear that Republicans are even aiming to drastically reduce emissions — their aims are pretty limited.

The strictly innovation-policy proposal in this plank is to **[double early-stage science research funding](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-lucas-its-time-to-reinvest-in-american-science-and-technology/)**. There’s broad agreement in the climate that such an investment would be good, but some critics might prefer more ambition in two ways. First, confining the investment to early-stage research could be viewed as insufficient, as opposed to funding [research, development ,*demonstration, and deployment*](https://scottpeters.house.gov/climate-playbook-section/research-development-demonstration-deployment). Second, doubling investment is low relative to a lot of prominent proposals, such as Bill Gates’ call to quintuple research funding in his recent climate book. 

There are three other specific policies in this section that are not covered by the other planks. The EIA **opposes carbon pricing** and **supports carbon capture**. Their opposition to carbon pricing contradicts their desire for market solutions and technological innovation, but I’m sure I don’t need to reiterate that on this sub. In case anyone wants an overview of carbon pricing policy, this is a [good report](https://www.wri.org/research/putting-price-carbon-evaluating-carbon-price-and-complementary-policies-15deg-world). The EIA also **opposes US participation in the Paris Agreement**.

There are references to natural gas and nuclear power in this section, but I will cover those in their respective sections.

#Nuclear 

I have a lot of opinions about this section, so I’m going to put a concrete wall between the actual proposals and my analysis

### EIA proposals on nuclear

There are two new nuclear proposals in the EIA. They also link to some op-eds and already-adopted bills, but there are only two on-the-table proposals.

One of them wants to establish a [US uranium reserve](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-latta-we-need-to-establish-a-uranium-reserve/) so that America doesn’t need to rely on other countries for nuclear fuel. The other would have the US [advocate for the World Bank to finance nuclear projects](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-mchenry-bring-back-financing-for-nuclear-power-at-the-world-bank/) in the developing world. The World Bank has not been funding nuclear projects [since 2013](https://grist.org/climate-energy/world-bank-says-no-to-nuclear-as-it-lays-out-universal-energy-plan/ ).

### Subatomic levels of ambition: These policies aren’t enough

*This is now my analysis.*

If you want to see more nuclear power in the United States, this agenda is pretty lacking. Nuclear faces a lot of [hurdles](https://rootsofprogress.org/devanney-on-the-nuclear-flop). Plants take literal [decades and billions of dollars](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J) to build. **There simply is not an appetite among utilities and investors in the US to expand nuclear electricity**. 

For all their pro-nuclear rhetoric, Republicans’ policy proposals don’t even approach these roadblocks. At the end of the Obama administration, famously pro-nuclear Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz commissioned a [report](https://www.energy.gov/seab/downloads/final-report-task-force-future-nuclear-power) on **what it would take to get significant expansion of nuclear in America**. I think it’s still one of the best guides out there. That report identified the following seven issues. 

- Absence of a carbon price	
- Technical, cost, and regulatory uncertainties of new nuclear tech	
- Waste management and public acceptance	
- Projected market conditions	
- Unanticipated intervening events, like accident	
- Overnight capital costs	
- Electricity markets must recognize the value of carbon-free electricity

At the risk of sounding like a partisan hack, Republican proposals don’t help with any of this. Two of their top energy priorities would even make nuclear’s situation a lot worse. Their support for natural gas and their vehement opposition to carbon pricing both exacerbate nuclear’s overriding problem: cost competitiveness. Nuclear simply costs more than gas and renewables, so no one builds it. Republican policies only leave that cost gap to fester. 

If you want nuclear in a green economy, the only way is for it to **fill a very particular niche** on a zero-carbon grid. The only logical place for it is to be the **reliable baseload complementing renewables that are cheaper but [variable](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11257)**. But Republican policies would eliminate that crucial niche by preserving a role for natural gas. If cheap, plentiful natural gas is still an option, who in their right mind would invest in nuclear?

# Natural Gas

Republicans are big fans of natural gas. Most of the gas policy proposals in the Energy Innovation Agenda concern domestic gas production and consumption, as you can read outlined on the Agenda webpage. Republicans want to **allow drilling for gas on federal lands**, and they want **building gas pipelines to be easier**. They are mad at Biden for cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline, but gas pipelines were struggling even during the Trump administration for a variety of reasons.

One point on natural gas that I actually wish Republicans put more focus on is **American gas exports**, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG). Republicans really love LNG exports, and the Trump administration put out official materials calling natural gas “[molecules of US freedom](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48454674).” From a climate perspective, Republicans postulate that other countries will still need gas for years to come, so they might as well use US gas because it is less carbon intensive than Russian gas. 

The **energy transitions of developing countries is something** I wish Democrats would address. India and Africa will grow in population and industrialize over the coming decades, and what energy they use to do so will have huge climate impacts. China’s [Belt and Road Initiative has invested a lot in coal](https://www.cfr.org/blog/climate-challenge-and-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative) around the developing world, although it looks like they will phase that out moving forward. In 2019, the Department of Energy put out a [report](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/09/f66/2019%20NETL%20LCA-GHG%20Report.pdf) measuring the lifecycle emissions of US LNG and Russian gas in European and Asian markets. They found that **American LNG has lower carbon emissions than Russian gas**. In Europe, American LNG was 29% cleaner than Russian gas over 20 years and 10% cleaner over 100 years. In Asia, 32% over 20 years and 11% over 100 years. While it is important to get to global net zero emissions around mid-century, any partial emissions reductions we make along the way will also have an impact.

Now, there is room for debate as to whether the US should support expanding gas use in developing countries. Doing so may lock those energy systems on a fossil-dependent path, delaying the transition to zero-carbon power. But on the other hand, these countries are [already investing in](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/natural-gas-renewables-key-to-india-decarbonization.html)  gas expansion, so it may as well be cleaner, geopolitically-better American gas. And perhaps the US could use its influence as an exporter to promote [carbon capture on gas plants](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/1/17416444/net-power-natural-gas-carbon-air-pollution-allam-cycle).

Now I should also note that Republicans mainly promote gas exports to European countries. That’s quite silly, really, as Europe has viable zero-carbon power options in solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear.

# Renewables

The Republicans’ proposals on renewable energy come in three buckets: **expanding hydropower, supporting hydrogen fuel, and supporting critical mineral production**. To be clear, hydropower (hydro) refers to generating electricity by moving water through a turbine, such as in a dam. Hydrogen power uses the element hydrogen as a fuel source.

On hydropower, Republicans want to make permitting and licensing regulations lighter for new dams and [pumped hydro storage](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower). On critical minerals, which are necessary for solar panels, batteries, and other pieces of the electricity puzzle, Republicans are very concerned about concentration of the supply chain in China, so they want more American production of minerals. And on hydrogen, Republicans want to expand one federal loan program from covering hHydrogen fuel cell technology” to also cover hydrogen “production, delivery, infrastructure, storage, fuel cells, and end uses.”

I should provide a few notes of context about hydropower. I won’t go into much detail since this post is pretty long and hydro isn’t hugely prominent in energy policy debates. First, there is a question of how much room for expansion there is in US hydro since we already have dams pretty much everywhere they could be. However, the Department of Energy believes that we could expand hydro by electrifying dams that currently do not provide any power. A [2016 DOE report](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/articles/hydropower-vision-new-chapter-america-s-1st-renewable-electricity-source) estimated that US hydro capacity could increase by around 50% by 2050. And industry observers say that there is also room to grow for [pumped hydro storage](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/to-batteries-and-beyond-in-a-high-renewables-world-pumped-hydro-storage-c/584958/). Finally, I should just note for the record that constructing [new dams releases a large amount of methane](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/hundreds-new-dams-could-mean-trouble-our-climate).

I would be remiss if I did not note how unusual it is to roll out a big climate agenda with a section dedicated to nuclear power without any thought given to deployment of wind or solar energy. Huge strides are being made in those areas, and the Republican plan just misses it entirely. There are policy issues that need to be addressed to achieve widespread wind and solar deployment. We need to address [variability](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11257), energy [storage](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/9/20767886/renewable-energy-storage-cost-electricity), and the infamous [duck curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve). But Republicans have offered no ideas to address these issues, at least as far as the Energy Innovation Agenda is concerned.

# Regulatory Reform

I will admit that I will have to learn more about the energy industry to offer a substantive evaluation of these specific legislative proposals. But I can summarize what they do. The three bills proposed under this plank seek to reduce the regulatory burden associated with creating and maintaining energy infrastructure. These regulatory changes range from reducing the time associated with federal environmental impact reviews to only applying regulations dealing with increased pollution to actions resulting in increased pollution.

From my perspective as a center-left, climate oriented person who follows energy policy as a hobby, they seem good but rather small. 

# Natural Solutions and Conservation

In this area, Republicans focus on **forestry and farming**. Their signature proposal in this area has been the **Trillion Trees Act**, which seeks to plant one trillion trees over thirty years — with the objective of [cutting them down again](https://grist.org/climate/republicans-want-to-plant-1-trillion-trees-and-then-log-them/) for lumber. Reforestation is a popular climate policy, but the [climate impact](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/scientists-question-trillion-trees-plan-as-climate-strategy) of the Trillion Trees Act is questionable. [Another forestry proposal](/https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-blake-moore-incorporating-innovative-technology-into-our-reforestation-efforts/) in the Energy Innovation Agenda would have the federal government use drones and other high-tech methods in reforestation efforts. And another proposal would provide [grants for the creation of urban forests](https://republicanleader.house.gov/rep-malliotakis-on-urban-forests/) .

On farming, Republicans want to pay for [precision agriculture](https://www.republicanleader.gov/rep-hinson-lets-work-with-our-farmers-not-against-them/), which uses technology for greater efficiency. They also want to provide funds and technical assistance for farmers to use techniques to [increase soil carbon sequestration](https://www.republicanleader.gov/rep-davis-lets-find-workable-natural-solutions-that-benefit-our-farmers/), such as rotating crop types and planting cover crops. 

Finally, Republicans also want to focus on forest management techniques to mitigate wildfires.

# Overall analysis

The first few times that I read through the Energy Innovation Agenda, I had a feeling of frustration that was hard to place. I’m glad that the Republican Party is engaging on climate policy, which is unambiguously better than being a part of climate denial. But I have pondered, what if they implemented every single policy they propose? My problem is that the Republicans’ big plan — supposedly their answer to Biden’s proposals and the Green New Deal — would probably do very little to reduce emissions.

We can illustrate this if we think about all the different areas in which emissions need to be reduced. You can see those laid out on the table below.

### US total GHG emissions by sector (2016)

*Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#by-country-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-sector)*

Emissions category | Amount (megatons CO2e) | **Solutions** | **Challenges**                      
---|---|---|---
Electricity &amp; heat | 2,150 (36%) | Zero-carbon power | Intermittency, cost, deployment
Transport | 1,710 (29%) | Electric and zero-carbon vehicles, public transit | EV infrastructure, airplanes
Buildings | 497 (8%) | Electrification | long stock life, cost
Manufacturing &amp; construction | 434 (7%) | zero-carbon steel, concrete, plastic creation | needs R&amp;D
Agriculture | 381 (6%) | Animal emissions, tractors | needs R&amp;D
Fugitive emissions | 292 (5%) | Stop gas leaks, new appliances | implementation
Industry | 222 (4%) | high heat processes | needs R&amp;D
Waste | 131 (2%) | [See here](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg3-chapter10-1.pdf) | [See here](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg3-chapter10-1.pdf) 
Aviation &amp; shipping | 127 (2%) | zero carbon fuels | expensive, needs R&amp;D
*Other* | 95  (2%)| | |

This table only includes US emissions. It is important to consider how US policy might enable global emissions reductions, especially in India and Africa, where billions of people will become rich consumers in the next few decades. But for the sake of a simple table, consider first just US emissions.

If the whole Energy Innovation Agenda were implemented, I can’t see the emissions picture changing that much. If we start with electricity, the largest source of emissions, there is not much to work with. Most electricity-related policy in the Republican Agenda promotes natural gas, which is probably already as widespread as it will get. It was great that natural gas kicked us off of coal, but further progress on emissions will require us to move to zero-carbon power sources. Aside from gas, I’m sure easier licensing requirements might give a little boost to hydropower, but otherwise, **the electricity policies don’t promise much change to our mix of power**. 

Instead of promoting different power sources, a lot of the Republican proposals aim to make the US **energy independent**, such as by getting our own supplies of uranium and critical minerals. There may not be anything wrong with independent supply chains, but that will not do much to address the underlying factors enabling or preventing the expansion of zero-carbon power.

Maybe the biggest missing piece from this Agenda is the lack of any transportation policies. Nothing to promote zero-emissions vehicles or public transportation. Certainly no urbanism. The support of hydrogen research will *maybe* give a boost to clean air travel R&amp;D. But even this policy doesn’t actually increase funding for R&amp;D; it just expands the types of hydrogen projects that can be funded.

I won't go through every single thing that is neglected by these proposals. I think a review of our emissions will suffice on its own. But the overall point is that these proposals really nibble around the edges in terms of getting us closer to net zero.

A phrase that keeps coming to my mind is **climate policy without climate change**. What I mean by that is, even though Republicans have packaged this as climate policy, they seem to have a lot of goals other than reducing emissions. They want US energy independence. They want to compete with China. They want to support the logging industry. They want to support farmers. I’m sure that’s all very nice, but it is not emissions reductions.

And, at least in the timeframe contemplated by all these policies, Republicans seem to have **no intention of getting to net zero emissions**. They never articulated such a goal in this plan, and the policies do not point that way. To be sure, these policies do have emissions-reducing potential, but they also solidify the foothold of carbon-intensive activities like burning natural gas and cutting down trees. 

**I shouldn’t be all negative**. I love R&amp;D investments, so if Republicans want to increase those, by all means. I appreciate the support of carbon capture, which will be necessary. I appreciate the occasional consideration of reducing emissions in other countries, which is a neglected facet of the US policy debate.

So in my view, I am glad that the Republican Party is thinking about climate policy. I think that indicates that they believe it to be politically important. We still have room to grow to a point where (1) Republican climate policy aims for net zero emissions and (2) Republicans prioritize climate enough to actually legislate rather than just talking about proposals. 

But in the long slog of climate politics, this is a step in the right direction.

802,"How the state of South Carolina became the catalyst for several crucial turning points in American history Ahh, my home state of South Carolina. One of the original thirteen states, it's much bigger and more populated than most of the New England states, but overshadowed by nearby larger states such as Florida and Virginia. It is the only original state besides Rhode Island to never produce a president. Technically, Andrew Jackson was born here, but that's not exactly something to be proud of. Despite it's modest size, however, it has played extremely crucial parts in several important eras of American history and politics, from the Revolutionary and Civil War to the democratic primary last year.

South Carolina history effectively starts with the city of Charleston, a port city founded all the way back in 1670. It's first footprint in history was being hostage by the notorious pirate Blackbeard in order to capture the cities medical supplies. Today, it's a far less important city. Users here may know it as the basis of Joe Cunningham's district, who gave the democrats a surprise victory in 2018 and tragically lost in an election just as close in 2020.

Where South Carolinian history truly begins on a national level, however, is [during the Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_theater_of_the_American_Revolutionary_War). Although northern states were far more united in their opposition to the British, South Carolina and the South was more more split, effectively a battleground state. Charleston and the lower country part of the state heavily backed the Patriots, while the upper parts of the state heavily backed the British. At the start of the war, Charleston quickly fell to the Patriots, catching the British off guard, and the Patriots [successfully fended off a British attempt to recapture the city.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sullivan%27s_Island) Our state owes its nickname to this battle, in fact, as the hastily built Fort Moultrie contained Palmetto tree logs which absorbed the damage of the British cannonballs. Despite initial success for the Patriots, the war would quickly turn sour in the south. Realizing the South was vulnerable due to heavy Loyalist support, the British quickly took back neighboring Savannah Georgia, and turned their eyes back on Charleston in 1780. After facing heavy defeats in the north, the British [recaptured Charleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Charleston), and months later took advantage of a key Patriot fuckup at the [Battle of Camden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Camden), effectively taking back the South. This would prove to be the last hurrah for the British, however. Over the next year, guerilla warfare tactics led by [various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sumter) South Carolinian [Patriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Marion) [leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Pickens_(congressman)) would cripple the British grip on the South, causing them to abandon the Carolinas, and would ultimately be defeated at the Battle of Yorktown just above in southeast Virginia one year later. This was and remains to be a very celebrated period in South Carolina history, and my childhood is full of visiting sites of Patriot victories fought here. From here on out, however, SC history takes a darker turn.

SC history resumes with the [nullification crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_crisis) in 1832. Both sides were led by figures born in SC; against South Carolina was President Andrew Jackson, and his Vice President John C Calhoun. In 1828, the federal government signed a [massive tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_Abominations) into law. Designed to shield northern factories in the North, it screwed over Southern plantations in the South, who heavily relied on foreign exports, leading to it's nickname ''Tariff of Abominations''. It pissed off South Carolina to the point that the state legislature declared it unconstitutional, leading to the crisis. At its most dire point, [Jackson was ready to send Federal troops into the state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Bill) to resolve the crisis. Ultimately, the crisis ended peacefully with a new [tariff negotiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1833). However, it set a precedent for states rights and southern states challenging federal authority, and it would be less than 30 years later when the state of South Carolina challenged federal authority again.

After Lincoln was elected president, South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union. From here on out, SC history becomes truly whack. Fearing that Lincoln would crack down on slavery, the SC legislation unanimously voted to secede from the Union. To get an idea of what was going through the heads of these guys at the time, take a loot at these quote from Presbyterian pastor James Henley Thornwell.  ''The parties in the conflict are not merely abolitionists and slaveholders. They are atheists, socialists, communists, red republicans, Jacobins on the one side, and friends of order and regulated freedom on the other. In one word, the world is the battleground – Christianity and Atheism the combatants; and the progress of humanity at stake. '' Followed by '' Anti-slavery is essentially infidel. It wars upon the Bible, on the Church of Christ, on the truth of God, on the souls of men.'' Really makes you think. This was the catalyst for the rest of the South to secede. Back to the city of Charleston; shortly after announcing secession, the South Carolina militia bombed [Fort Sumter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Sumter), a Union fort on the outskirts of the Charleston harbor, effectively declaring war. The fort stands to this day; I visited the fort twice on school field trips. A Confederate flag remained on the fort until 2015, after the Dylan Roof shootings. Again, really makes you think.

As such, the American Civil War ensued. Although most of the fighting occurred to the North, South Carolina was not forgotten; after Sherman's march to the Sea, Sherman marched through South Carolina as a final middle finger to the Confederacy. [The Union Flag was once again raised on Fort Sumter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_the_Flag_at_Fort_Sumter); however, outside of SC, the event was forgotten about as Lincoln was shot on the same day. Reconstruction ensued; after a brief period in which Black Americans were able to be elected, however, the South eventually [fell back in the hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Democrat) of the [old political vanguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Hampton_III). But it wasn't until a certain politician was elected when Black Americans lost all of their newly gained rights, and a certain divisive figure caused South Carolina to re-enter national politics, however.

Enter Benjamin Tillman. An unabashed white supremacist of farmer origins, he is perhaps the closest historical comparison you can find to Donald Trump. Although Tillman himself was fairly well off, he was never included in the Bourbon Democrat elite, and was able to posture himself as a populist on the side of poor white farmers. After becoming governor seizing power from the Bourbon establishment, Tillman enforced numerous policies, included but not limited to; near complete disenfranchisement of Black Americans, which established a precedent other Southern states followed, tolerance of a spike in lynching's, [a state run monopoly on alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Dispensary), various populist policies in support of farmers, and, interestingly enough, the creation of Clemson University. Yes, that Clemson. Our most well known university that wins national football titles owes it's existence due to a white supremacists hatred [of the existing well known state college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina) and his desire to create an agricultural alternative. Although unbeknown outside of the state nowadays, Tillman was not ignored on the national level at that time. A skilled orator who could easily rile up his supporters at home, he was also frequent critic of president Grover Cleveland. Known nationally as ''Pitchfork Ben'' for threatening to use a pitchfork on Cleveland, Tillman himself was a potential Democratic candidate for President in 1896. This failed due to two reasons; one, [another populist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan) made his debut at the 1896 Democratic Convention, and two, because of Tillman's own disastrous speech.  He is quoted as having  ""spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism.'' Although this style might also do well in a 2016 GOP debate, it failed at the national level, as he gave  ''by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction"". After the convention, Tillman slowly lost political favor at home, his [political heir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman_Livingston_Blease) was a disaster, and South Carolina faded from national politics until another infamous figure rose to prominence.

Enter Strom Thurmond. Unlike Tillman, Thurmond was a far more successful national figure, and many on this sub may be familiar with him. After serving in WW2, Thurmond returned home and became governor of SC in 1947, at the fairly young age of 44. Despite his inexperience however, Thurmond would become the nominee of the Dixiecrats in the 1948 Presidential Election, establishing himself in the South outside of SC. After one term as governor, Thurmond ran for senate in 1950, but narrowly lost the Democratic primary. It would be the only state electoral defeat Thurmond suffered in his long political career. After an special senate election was triggered, Thurmond once again ran for office. Despite his popularity, Thurmond, like Tillman, was not liked by the [state party establishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnwell_Ring), and wouldn't even let him enter the Democratic primary. In response, Thurmond would pull a Lisa Murkowski and launch a [launch a write in campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_United_States_Senate_election_in_South_Carolina), crushing the establishment pick. In keeping with a campaign promise, Thurmond resigned two years later and won another election unopposed to serve the remainder of his term. After regaining his position, Thurmond would not leave the senate again until January 3rd, 2003, alive at the age of 100. During his time in the senate, Thurmond became one of the most well known critics of civil rights, going so far as to lead a [24 hour filibuster against a civil rights bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond_filibuster_of_the_Civil_Rights_Act_of_1957) (Thurmond was a health nut, hence him living to 100). Later on, he would support Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential election, and in that same year switched parties. It was the catalyst for the gradual party switches across each parties that followed, as the liberal GOP wing fled to the Democratic Party, and conservative Democrats fled to the GOP. Despite this, Thurmond would slowly change on civil rights, eventually voting to make the birthday of MLK a federal holiday. Nevertheless, Thurmond was an adamant Republican, supporting Reagan in 1980 and helped shift the state of South Carolina toward the Republican Party. The GOP has effectively been in full control of the state since Thurmond's death, with the last SC governor and senator leaving office shortly before and after he passed away. Ironically, shortly after his death, [it was revealed that Thurmond had been the father of a mixed race daughter way back in 1925.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essie_Mae_Washington-Williams) It was a secret she had to keep for decades, until she was 78 years old herself.

And finally, we arrive at the last and most recent leg of SC politics, one that I have bared witness to myself. In my time alive, we [elected a tea partier before the tea party happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_Senate_election_in_South_Carolina), endured an embarrassing [governor scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sanford_extramarital_affair), and elected Nikki Haley to governorship in 2010. Where the real drama begins, however, is during the 2016 Presidential Election. In February 2016, we gave Donald Trump [his first major primary victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_South_Carolina_Republican_presidential_primary), establishing Trump as the front runner and ending Jeb Bush's campaign. One could say this is when the pre-trump GOP endured it's final nail in the coffin. Although Trump had won in New Hampshire earlier, this was the first state with a winner take all rule, giving Trump all of our delegates. At the same time, the 2016 SC Democratic primary occurred, in which Sanders was absolutely [CRUSHED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_South_Carolina_Democratic_presidential_primary). After Sanders won New Hampshire and inched closer to the nomination, South Carolina dealt his campaign a massive blow. It was the first state with a sizeable Black American population, and it properly gauged just how unpopular Sanders was with them. Younger, less politically knowledgeable me was much more sympathetic to Sanders, and it was a massive shock seeing just anti-Sanders my state was. I was never a huge Hillary hater, but seeing how popular she was here changed my view of her, and made me turn on Sanders supporters who called our Black American population ''low information voters.'' It also served as a foreshadowing of the 2020 SC democratic primary. As we all remember, Biden dominated here and Sanders once again floundered. It was the perfect timing, after Sanders victory in Nevada and just before Super Tuesday. At the time, no area of the US was more sympathetic to the current democratic establishment, and Biden being Obama's VP was a perfect fit. It also doubles as the moment I found this sub out. If I recall, the users at r/politics had managed to catch on to this sub as the results came in, which was probably the most sympathetic Biden sub in the entirety of reddit. Originally, I was half-way sympathetic, as I still liked Sanders but I noticed the sub had a peculiar thing going on called the Discussion Thread. Sure enough, I now spend a decent amount of my free time shitposting on the DT. Thanks, Jim Clyburn.

So there you have it. A notable participant in the Revolutionary War, starter of the Civil War, homeland of the proto Trump, catalyst to the party switch of the 1960s and beyond, and finally a beginning point of both Trumpism and Biden's presidency, South Carolina has bared witness to a significant amount of change in American politics, both past, present, and perhaps the future, if Nikki Haley can make a run for president.",1,0.103,0.766,0.13,0.9949
803,"Primary review: wrap up This is the widest primary field in history in terms of size, race, gender and sexual orientation. There are other candidates that are not featured in this series, such as Kirsten Gillibrand, Jay Inslee, Seth Moulton, or [Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/g8cvna/primary_review_joe_biden/fopt9e0), that you might want to talk about. So use this post to do so. 

Here’s what you can talk about: 

**Policies**: what’s good about the policies he/she proposed, and what’s bad about the policies, and whether should Biden adopt them as part of his platform. 

**Campaign strategy**: what about the candidate’s strategy worked, and where did the candidate fall short. Some of the areas include, but not limited to, messaging, ideological positioning etc. What can a future candidate for office learn from his/her campaign. 

**Impact on the primary**: how did the candidate make a difference in the primary. 

Remember to try to keep to these points to ensure a substantive discussion. Don’t downvote things you disagree with, instead try to make your case, unless the comment is based on false premises.

I’m also interested in knowing after reading the discussions of all the candidates, how has your perception on the candidates changed. 

Ultimately, running for President is really hard, and filled with loads of uncertainties. A candidate can have a very impressive resume and falter due to a flawed campaign. A candidate can also have a short resume but a good campaign to last long. One can have questionable policies but still gain immense support. One can have great policies but fail to gain traction. Having certain attributes affect one’s margin of error, allowing the candidate to make mistakes and still come out of it unscathed. Don’t underestimate how much luck plays into one’s success or failure, per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/databyler/status/1201534965999001601). So, don’t feel bad or resentful if your candidate falters, because the truth is its more likely your candidate fails than succeeds, and there’s loads of factors outside of your candidate’s control that’ll affect his/her success. 

Here are the previous candidate’s discussions:

I was Bernie or Bust before, but after Vaush made a good video explaining why USA left should vote for Biden, I changed my mind because it made more sense to have Biden than Trump.

With all that said, after exploring your sub, I have questions:

-How and are you different from Libertarians?

-Do you consider yourself Auth Right, Lib Right or maybe even center or Left?

-Opinion on social programs such are UBI, Universals Healthcare, Pensions

810,"How do you stave off feelings of hopelessness? Maybe this works better in r/depression, but I figured some people here could relate.

How do you guys keep hope for the future of this country? I don't mean that in a bad faith way, I'm really asking how. Years ago when I was a teen and could separate politics from my day to day life, I could brush it off with a ""it's just politics"". But as Trump got more erratic, I became of voting age, and politics began to bleed into real life, I changed my tune, especially with how bad COVID got under incompetent leadership. 

I was elated when Biden won and Dems took control of congress, but since then the afterglow has faded. Yeah the Stimulus was passed, and Biden is handling the pandemic how it should've been from the start, but I feel like that's all. Maybe Infrastructure with Budget Reconciliation. Until then, we have 2, maybe more, Senators that won't let go of this idea that the GOP is willing to negotiate in the spirit of ""bipartisainship"". 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not gonna dunk on Manchin for being sensible to his state's politics, and Sinema (my own Senator) is just another can of worms altogether. I mean, she basically told her constituents to fuck off via jewelry. But is there nothing that gets through to them? I mean, while the POTUS is a busy man, my hope is that he's trying to work with them behind the scenes. But who knows, really?

&amp;nbsp;

It seems that bills like HR1 will go nowhere, and gerrymandering &amp; voter suppression bills may lose the Dems the house in '22. Not trying to sound like a doomer (believe me, I know doomerism, I was in the Joe Biden discord August to February), and I don't claim to be a polisci expert, but I won't go around saying ""the GOP is finished"", because really they are currently in a position where they're at a temporary setback. It's just political realities. But if those guys get power back, we know the ""sensible"" Republicans won't be in power. And most of their politicians have no coherent ideology, just enriching themselves and making people's lives miserable. Just cartoon villain shit.

&amp;nbsp;

Plus, it's easy to blame the politicians, but the people elect the politicians. I mean, a good chunk of the GOP electorate is now sympathetic to some bizarre 8chan brainworms-level conspiracy on some level or another, and I would wager money that some amount of them would love nothing more than to indulge an itchy trigger finger. How can the US move forward when enough of the electorate to matter lives in a different reality altogether?

&amp;nbsp;

It's just frustrating to watch it all (or in some cases, watch nothing). And, let's face it, the average voter doesn't give a fuck about Senate procedure or the daily workings of Washington DC. How many voters know what a filibuster is, or who Joe Manchin is (outside of WV)? Maybe it's just my predisposition to depressive episodes, but it just feels hopeless. I'll probably have kids one day, and I want to leave them a better world. But when the political half that wants to ensure that happens instead of doing the exact opposite out of pure spite is, let's face it, clinging to power, is there reason to have hope? Do the fine people of r/neoliberal have ways or things they hold out hope for? I don't really rant to my therapist about politics, but at least I have internet randos lol.",1,0.117,0.76,0.123,-0.2572

However, I also have some views that are spread throughout the political aisle, so I'd like to share and see what you guys think my ideology lines up closest to. 

Economics:

\- I support universal healthcare. I think it's moral that every person no matter their economic background or views should receive quality care when it comes to issues regarding their health and wellbeing. 

\- I believe that both Capitalism and Socialism have their flaws and pros. Therefore, the best system in my opinion is a hybrid, in other words Social Democracy or Social Capitalism

\- I want the minimum wage raised to $15

\- I support unions

\- I am opposed to governments bailing out large corporations in times of need when regular people could use some help

\- I think the government should create incentives for people to get their feet wet into entrepreneurship. This way, small businesses can accelerate growth and flourish and prevent certain niche fields from being taken over by monopolies. 

\- I do think people should be able to be millionaires and billionaires, but you gotta pay your fair share in taxes. 

\- I think a UBI is an interesting experiment that could benefit society more as opposed to high taxes 

Social Views:

\- I support marriage equality

\- I support trans rights, but am still very confused and uncomfortable with people pushing the narrative of ""gender is a social construct"" and all of these pronouns such as they. Nonetheless, I support their rights.

\- I believe weed should be legalized 

\- I think America's police system is militarized and that reform is necessary

\- I believe climate change is a massive problem that will screw over Gen X and younger if we don't work towards fixing it. 

Now for some less ""liberal"" views...

\- This one's gonna raise some eyebrows: I am against open borders (but still want Taco Trucks on every corner)

\- I am against race-based affirmative action and think that CRT is bullcrap.

\- I'm mostly pro-choice, up until the nervous system is developed. At that point, I'm a lot more cautious but would still reserve abortion for cases where the health of the party(s) is concerned

\- I think society puts too much focus on race. I'm brown and dislike when people bring up the term 'POC"" when referring to me as an individual and my work(s). It makes me feel like I'm being pampered and wish people would let go of this mentality.

\- I'm very pro free-speech unless the matter involves direct threats of violence, libel/slander, or anything regarding private info.

\- I'm against cancel culture and political correctness

Foreign Policy:

\- I think America's been in the Middle East for too long and it's time to pull out

\- I think some aspects of nationalism is good. For example, prioritizing an ""America First"" (not to be confused with the right-wing slogan) economic policy of stopping mass outsourcing of jobs will benefit those in need in the country. With that being said, I do think globalism overall is a good idea. 

\- I think it's good that Biden is recognizing Taiwan as a country and acknowledging the Armenian genocide. There are still some other events that the country had a role in and needs to acknowledge (ex. the 1971 Bangladesh Genocide which Nixon refused to aide Bangladesh and India in). 

These are just some of the views I have. I'm still pretty young so I'm not set in stone on what I'll do but I'd like to hear some opinions from you guys. Help me figure out where I am.",1,0.069,0.806,0.125,0.9858

-$100 billion for a new office in the Commerce Department ($50 billion) to monitor industrial capacity and fund investments in support of critical goods such as semiconductors; semiconductor manufacturing and research ($50 billion) as called for the CHIPS Act.

-$52 billion invested in domestic manufacturing, including modernizing the supply chain including the auto sector; creation of a new financing program to support debt and equity investment for manufacturing.

-- $35 billion for a range of solutions needed for technology breakthroughs, including demonstration projects for offshore wind, quantum computing, electric vehicles, and advanced rare earth element separations.

-- $120 billion for a new National Science Foundation directorate ($50 billion) to focus on semiconductors and advanced computing, communications and biotechnology; upgrades to research labs nationwide ($40 billion); and R&amp;D to spur innovation and job creation including in rural areas ($30 billion)

--$14 billion for National Institutes of Standards and Technology to bring industry, academia and government together to advance technologies for future competitiveness against China and others.

-Spending $100 billion over the next eight years to deploy broadband throughout rural America, according to the White House on Wednesday. Biden's plan also promises to reduce the cost of broadband for low-income individuals in an effort to make broadband more affordable. 

All in all, Joe Biden's plan is committed to including 150 billion for gamers, with an extra 221 billion that may be later allocated towards semiconducting technology. This is a total of 371 billion.

# The vaccine distribution rate has been mostly the same:

[https://imgur.com/a/kqEmuZh](https://imgur.com/a/kqEmuZh)

Viewing this graph, the rate at which the vaccines are being distributed hasn't increased very much.

**Trump at least 1 dose distribution rate:**

2,161,419 / 31 = 69,723

**Biden at least 1 dose distribution rate:**

&amp;#x200B;

At first glance, the rate between the two looks vastly different but you have to take into account that both numbers are extremely high. I put both rates on a graph and tried to find the angle difference using trigonometry but I made a stupid mistake on miscalculation the number of days Biden was in office.

[https://imgur.com/a/0LDgEi3](https://imgur.com/a/0LDgEi3)

As shown on the graph, the infection rate already seemed to be dropping off even before Trump had left office. This doesn't even take into account that Biden being in office doesn't immediately change the trajectory of the infection rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

While I am not saying Biden is doing a bad job or that he isn't doing better than trump. It is still important to understand that covid didn't start to disappear once Biden got into office.

i like joe biden and his plans, but i don't think he is gonna accomplish most of them as I'm sure they're gonna get roadblocked, but I'm ignorant so i may be wrong.

From what i know it seems that republicans are gonna win big in 2022, is that true?

And then democrats will have even more roadblocks than now.

Then moving on to 2024, then democrats can make a comeback, if they lose and most of biden's will not be accomplished or will get very watered down, what can we expect?

In your opinion is it likely for democrats then to win? And do you think that then democrats will be able to accomplish their plans? 

What about climate change.

I'm here looking for serious answers, you can mock my ignorance but it's not gonna help, I'm here to learn.

should we be very worried about the future of america and the world? are you worried?

But so far he’s been way left of Obama. People who supported Bernie and Warren are thrilled (and pleasantly surprised) with what he’s done and what he intends to do, because he’s spent 2 trillion and would like to spend 2 trillion more. He also would like more manufacturing in America, when its clearly no longer our comparative advantage.

Some background on my perspective:
i’m turning 20 this year so the first time i voted was in 2020 (biden), but i think i would have voted for HW Bush, then clinton, then Bush twice, then Obama, Romney, and Clinton. I’m fiscally conservative and somewhat of a neocon. I am very pro free trade and pro immigration (standard neolib stuff), so i consider myself to be center right/ even a progressive republican. i am not really socially conservative. 

My hot take: we (GOP) absolutely deserve to lose political capital and seats in the house, senate, and local elections, until we learn to behave ourselves. The republican party is a national hazard and it must prove itself to be electable in order to be a viable party. I was hoping in 2016 that reps would look into the failures of the romney campaign (ex: his inability to capture minority voters, being unrelatable, etc) but when trump joined the game, the worst elements of the tea party combined with trumps special brand of narcissism and xenophobia became the winning strategy. The republican party has lowkey started to become shit since the rise of the tea party but trump basically accelerated that and now the party consists of hogs that are anti democracy and liberty. The republican party is anti american. 

So, they deserve to lose political power. The republican party needs to become MUCH MUCH more moderate and less white supremacy friendly. it is not enough to have romney, cheney, and kinzinger when the rest of the party has basically completely lost it. 

I have decided that no matter how fiscally conservative/ all around moderate a republican candidate is, i will not support them unless they are openly and FIRMLY against trumps big lie that the election was stolen from him. i am going to vote dem until this happens and i am hoping that democrats keep the senate in 2022. Even someone like nikki haley isn’t worth it. I’m voting dem in 2024 and i want to see the GOP fall so that an electable and non hazardous conservative party will hopefully take its place one day.",1,0.102,0.726,0.173,0.9857

So I've always had a fairly high level of interest in UK politics and, though not unusual for this sub, some unusual sympathies in general. Big fan of Thatcher and Blair. I sort of liked Cameron and really liked Clegg and of course that didn't work out. For me, it'a always been a question of which party can best advance the liberal tradition. In the 1980s, it was the Thatcher Conservatives and in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was the Blair-ites. And now... Boris Johnson is a demagogue who panders to right-wing bigots and seems to have a corruption problem, Starmer is far better than Corbyn but still quite left, and Ed Davey and the Lib Dems are pretty damn good but have next to zero chance of winning power. Still, I would say some co-operation between Labour and the Lib Dems would offer the best prospects for liberalism given the ugliness of Johnson's xenophobic brand of conservatism and that brings me to my questions for our British and more informed than I non-British members...

1. Can you imagine a realistic scenario where Labour and the Lib Dems co-operate to beat the Conservatives. This would be desirable from a governing standpoint on economic policy but I'm not sure how realistic it is as a political strategy.

2. There is a lot of talk that Starmer will be out before the next election. I know the recent local election results were shit for Labour but the idea that he wouldn't even get a shot to lead the party into one election seems pretty harsh on the guy. What do you all think of him... he seems very smart, though, as I said, pretty left-wing.

3. Many people are suggesting Andy Burnham would replace him. I heard one UK journalist say Burnham could be Labour's Joe Biden and the two are similar except for the age file. Why do so many think Burnham is the right answer to Labour's problems and how does he compare ideologically to Starmer

Harsh voter suppression laws are being rolled out across the country. Red states are rewriting their election verification processes to let them overrule results they don’t like. A Republican Supreme Court has awarded a disputed election to their preferred candidate once (in 2000) and I have no reason to think that they wouldn’t do so again, if they got a plausible enough opportunity.

First time I browsed through this sub I was like, ""Oh my god! A sub filled with a disgusting bunch of corporate bootlickers"". I was really addicted to the dirtbag left's Kool-Aid. But the more I looked through this sub and listened to the online left's arguments, it was clear that that was just a caricature. I think I might be a neoliberal (or a neoliberal-curious at least).

Here's what I like/think:

\- The dirtbag left loves to hurl insults and criticisms while not contributing anything(Looking at   
  you, Kyle ""Politics is not hard"" Kulinski)

\- Evidence based policies are based.

\- Everyone thinks they understand economics, but in reality no one understands economics.

\- I hate people who hate globalists. Nationalism is useful to maintain societal cohesion but in the   
  long run if we don't realize that we're all in this together, we're fucked.

\- ""Defund The Police"" was the dumbest most moronic slogan one could have come up with.(So   
   you're gonna shout Defund The Police! and then spend the next 15 minuets explaining why it   
   doesn't actually mean defund the police? Great messaging tactic guys!)

\- I know the neoliberal answer to solving homelessness in America is to just shout ""Commit mass build of high density housing!"" but I think the problem is the American culture is such that living in a high density housing is always considered a stepping stone to buying and living in a big single family house.

\- Free traderinos are net good.

\- UBI is based

\- Minimum wage is unbased (Just UBI that shit)

\- Barack Obama is based.

\- Tonald Drump is extremely unbased.

\- Joe Biden is based

\- Ced Truz is extremely unbased

\- Elizabeth Warren is based

\- Hosh Jawley is extremely unbased

I do have one question though, what is the neoliberal answer to why Trump was elected? The online left's answer seems to be some combination neoliberalism, Hillary was not a good campaigner, racism and the electoral college (I mean a majority of Americans did make the sane choice) but mostly neoliberalism and the Hillary thing.",1,0.107,0.781,0.113,-0.5621

Trumpism is here to stay, and with it is a deep distrust of democracy and racial antipathy. Yeah, the democrats won the 2020 election and the coup failed, but the GOP has committed itself to holding onto power by any means possible.  2022 and 2024 years are pivotal election years to ensure that Trumpism does not resurge. 

Furthermore, the last 4 years have damaged American institutions. That damage is not irrevocable, but someone needs to repair it. And at the end of the day, the power behind American institutions comes from the people. Quite a lot of the people have stopped believing in American intuitions. It's how a guy like Trump wins in the first place. 

Pinning our hopes on the Biden admin alone to just sort out and fix the deep divisions in America and restore trust in American institutions and democracy is foolish. I think the real antidote to Trumpism is the people dedicating themselves to civil engagement and making the world a better place. 

To that end, I think it would be meaningful to have a demonstration on January 6th in 2022 in support of fair and free elections, countering the false narrative by GOP thugs that the Capitol Siege was not that big a deal, and remembrance of the enormous sacrifice so many Americans made over our short history to keep the people free.",1,0.065,0.744,0.192,0.9903

944,"Thank you r/Neoliberal for helping me with the built-in victim complex/give up culture inherent in far left communities. Being a liberal has helped me in my personal life so much. I was a Bernie supporter, very far left-wing progressive until mid-way through the Democratic primaries. I ended up voting for Biden in the PA primary, as well as the General election, becoming a liberal around July. Before I became a liberal, I felt a strong persecution complex - that there is no way to succeed in the US, that I'm going to be stuck slaving away in a capitalist nightmare with no way out. 

Basically, months after becoming a liberal (Thanks to this subreddit and streamers like Destiny) my entire life fell apart. My parents didn't have good enough credit to sign my private loans for PSU, so I was kicked out. While this was a huge bummer, I was able to reasonably conclude that my actions have consequences, and I could have prevented it from. happening, or put off college altogether. 

Because of this reasonability, because I understand that the US is flawed, but still can be worked in, I have not given up. I am 100% sure I would have, had I still been a far leftist. I have worked 3 jobs and 80+ hour weeks for months to pay off the $8,000 I owe to PSU, and my life is amazing. Hard work and optimism that I can make it work has afforded me so many blessings. 

I have worked through everything. Convinced the school to let me pay off my debt over 2 years at 350~ dollars a month with no interest. I have worked my ass off at all three jobs, and it has massively paid off, with recommendations coming from higher ups at the medical center I work 2 jobs at, leading to the prospect of some *great* jobs to replace the third with, and even promotions without a degree that I could live off of. I've gotten a credit card and have been building credit, opened a Roth IRA, and have thousands in savings. 

My future is so bright to me. I'm loving working hard and making it in this country. I signed my first ever apartment lease with my girlfriend this month, and we moved in last week. Degree or no degree, I'm going to make it. It might sound really stupid or hokey, but liberalism has helped me see the world through a much more logical and patient lens. I feel capable for the first time. Things suck for people like me in America, but they're not all that bad - I can make it if I try.

But even if it was, i don’t see how you can at the same time praise Biden for his apparent refusal to refuse to endanger Children while also being fully complacent about Israel doing even worse things. 

I guess it’s self defense, but the truth is that the iron dome is what i’d call self defense. Israeli strikes have killed more palestinians in in the past week than any Hamas strikes  since their rise to power.



Also there’s lots of racism as well. I’ve Many here  here really think that Palestinians want to kill all israelis and would do so if they were given any power.

**Introduction**

Corporate Tax Rates have always been a controversial subject among economists, from every reason to revenue to growth. This post is meant to look at “modern” corporate tax cuts from more than 30 economies, the different economic climates they happened during, and what the future for corporate tax rates might look like. A few disclaimers, I would like to stress my second point. The economic climate does play an important role in these tax cuts, however, evidence also suggests these could have happened without said climate (as in a normal “boom” cycle of the economy). Another disclaimer is I do plan on mentioning specific tax plans, i obviously will not be able to mention them all, i write this because I don’t want it to seem im picking at specific tax plans for the hell of it, I picked these because they seemed relevant to the time period of corporate tax “reform”

**Background**

Corporate tax code changes, while always happening since their introduction in 1909 by the Tax ACT (USA), the real boost to the discussion of corporate tax rate came with the introduction of the Laffer’s curve in 1974. Since then we have seen corporate taxes decline in most developed countries, moreover, they have continuously made up a smaller and smaller share of revenue, with the USA at 1% of GDP (2019)  Europeans at 2.8-3.1% (2018) and Japan at 3.3% (2019). Other taxes such as personal income tax, consumption tax, and social contributions seem to make up the most of general revenue collected. The General Consensus with these cuts is that at the very least, fiscal neutrality was achieved, with certain cases showing a net benefit in tax revenue income (of course, things like deductions or increase in other tax rates was a factor).

**Corporate Taxes Now**

In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs ACT passed a partisan congress lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21%. This was done in a goal to give the US a competitive Corporate tax rate, as it matched the average European Corporate tax rate at the time (23%). This is still higher than countries such as Ireland, Cyprus, and the Netherlands, however it was seen as a good starting measure to returning profits from abroad. 

However, with the election of President Joe Biden, and his proposal to increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, specifically to pay for some of his proposed projects, have left many economists again debating the success of the corporate tax rate, and if raising it for revenue is all that effective. This had ultimately led to calls by the Secretary of The Treasury (Janet Yellen) for a global minimum corporate tax rate. The reaction seems to be mixed among both economists and countries.

To understand why, we must look at the average European Corporate Tax Rate. The average European CTR was 21.7%. Some of these countries have them higher than the average (Germany 29.9%, France 28.4% and Portugal 31.5%). There are also plenty of countries with lower rates than the average (Ireland 12.5%, Lithuania 15%, Great Britain 19%). Of course ⅚ of these countries are in the European Union, which allows free movement of goods and people (with the other country (Great Britain) having a extensive deal with said union, bet it not frictionless). The debate we are having globally now, has been happening in Europe since Nice (2003) and picked up since Lisbon (2009). The issue of Capital flight is a complicated one, and the role of varying Corporate Tax Rates among countries, certainly does not make for an easier solution.

**Declining Corporate Tax Rates**

Globally, Corporate Tax Rates have fallen, however this trend has been echoed the hardest in the “Developed” world. Many say this had happened due to the “supply side wave” in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, while others say this had happened due to their inefficiency to gain revenue, as business sales might go through third party entities that do not pay taxes (40% in the USA in 2016). However, no matter the reasoning, no one denies that corporate taxes have fallen dramatically the last 4 decades, falling 21% in Poland, 25.8% in Norway, and 34.6% in Spain (30 year period 1986-2016). Politicians since the introduction of the Laffer's curve, have debated all sorts of tax rates (specifically personal and corporate tax rates) and their “peak” in the curve.

The first major plan in America, came from economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka. They had proposed a 19% personal income and corporate tax, a modified version of this tax cut would be suggested to Reagan in 1984, by Tax Reform for Fairness, Simplicity, and Economic Growth. This ultimately never fully developed in congress, and later Reagan would pass the 1986 Tax Reform ACT which saw the corporate tax code change into the 35% rate the United States had until the Tax Cuts and Jobs ACT.

Countries in Europe saw a decline in their corporate tax on a far more drastic scale. For instance, Sweden, to increase competition, slashed their corporate tax rate from 57% to 30% in 1991. In Eastern and Central Europe, Once Estonia and Hungary cut their corporate tax rate, Poland and Slovakia followed suit, lowering their respective tax rates to a flat 19%. It is important to note, that all the tax cuts above (in Europe) happened during normal economic conditions during periods of growth, showing that under normal economic circumstances, corporate tax cuts have been relatively popular in stimulating economic growth, even in times of no economic crisis.

However, one major criticism about the Tax Cuts and Jobs ACT, was that it was not revenue neutral, meaning it lost the American government a potential 1-2 Trillion dollars in revenue from 2018-2025. However, many tax cuts have been revenue neutral, especially when looking at some cases in Europe.

**Revenue Neutral Corporate Tax Cuts**

The Tax Cuts and Jobs ACTs has drawn criticism from both left and right leaning economists. The main criticism was the loss of revenue. There have been many corporate tax cuts however, that have been revenue neutral.

For example Italy reduced its corporate tax rate in the early 1970s. In response they instituted the VAT that would ultimately be a net positive for revenue collection (even in a time of economic crisis). Another solid example could be in places like Hungary, where a decrease in corporate taxes (from 19% down to 9%) was followed by an increase tax on energy and financial institutions (both of which are controversial, however positive in revenue generation). Moreover, in the USA Ronald Reagan reduced the corporate rate from 48% to 34%, but he also got rid of 60 billion dollars in tax preferences and an alternative minimum tax on corporations. For the first 5 years of the reform, revenue had been depressed, however analysis showed that they had collected more corporate revenue otherwise, however a general depression in corporate profits had caused the decrease in yearly collection. Slovakia cut back on tax holidays for new businesses and agricultural subsidies in order to make the corporate tax cut legislated a revenue positive. It increased tax revenue GDP from 2.5% to 3.1% (2004-2005). 

These examples show that while most economists agree that tax cuts on their own are a revenue loss, if another rate is raised in response, it could be a net benefit to the economy. In fact most economists seem to agree it is the least defensible tax from an empirical standpoint, however, who carries the burden of the tax is more debated.

**Conclusion**

From 94 countries, findings show that within 3 years of a corporate tax cut, revenue rose in 48 of them, 10 of them saw no noticeable change, while 36 of them saw a small decline. In eastern European countries, Bulgaria, Poland, and Hungary, increase in personal income and value add taxes have compensated for their cuts in corporate tax rate. In Spain and in New Zealand proposals to increase other taxes in response to a corporate tax rate cut were planned, however due to the global financial crisis, taxes across the board were cut.

Findings also show that the average change in corporate tax revenue across the 94 cases, was only -.05% showing that fiscal neutrality in large, was achieved. In conclusion the modern corporate tax rates we have today, and their 4 decade decline trend, have been based on growth and fiscal neutrality.

That said, a lot of you cheered Biden's victory so I wanna know what exactly are you hoping to gain for your cause with this president and Democrats controlling the House and Senate? Do you actually think anything can be salvaged from the next 4 years?

Apart from maybe a softer stance on drugs and a slight chance of a serious conversation going around the issue of prostitution, I'm not seeing any potential win for a libertarian. The more Democrats can accomplish from their agenda, there worse it will be for the US, let me explain:

\- regulations on businesses can only go up  
\- taxes can only go up (contrary to popular belief your taxes can go up even if you're not very wealthy as long as you own a lot of stocks, higher taxes will have an impact on your stock performance since those companies will be paying more to the government than using the money to grow the business, hire more people or reward investors with dividends)  
\- you can expect a lot of racist policies masked as ""anti-racism"", critical race theory reintroduced into the training government official receive  
\- the government will be spending a lot of money and effort on the non-issue of ""income inequality"" or ""wealth inequality"", total non-issues to any true libertarian  
\- you can expect guns to be restricted further and self-defense will not be taken as seriously because they care more about the rights of home invaders than your own rights  
\- you can expect a foreign policy geared towards appeasing the worst scumbag regimes in the world (you can argue Trump was too friendly to Kim Jong Un, but NK is a mess that previous presidents allowed to get this far, 2 out of 3 being Democrat)  
\- no doubt some of you will be happy to see more open borders, but the end result is 11 million new voters (most of them Democrats), only a useful idiot thinks this is a ""win"" for the libertarian cause  
\- a police force less tough on crime which is the wrong approach, police should be tough on real crimes like murder and theft and take no action against fake crimes like drugs, prostitution or violating COVID restrictions

1031,"Farewell, Mr. Trump As of noon Eastern yesterday, Donald Trump is no longer the President of the United States. There's always a weird feeling whenever the leader of your country changes, especially after a few years of headlines, quotes, and opinions being hammered into your head, but this time around the changing of the guard seems much harder to get used to. ""Return to normalcy"" is the phrase a lot of people will surely use, and I'd be tempted to use it too if I felt that 'normalcy' was a much better alternative than the paranoid chaos of the Trump administration. Besides, even with a career politician back in the Oval Office, nothing looks normal about the federal government or the people that comprise it, at least not compared to this time four or five years ago. I suppose the reason why Inauguration Day is so unusual this time around is because it feels like the end of an entirely different story than was intended for outgoing Presidents.

Typically, when somebody becomes President of the United States, it is the logical conclusion to a decades-long legal resume, during which time they rose through the ranks from lawyer to state congressman to representative to senator, and so on. When looking at Donald Trump's life, however, his presidency seems more like a period of weirdness, a step away from an accomplished career in business, entertainment and real estate into an incredibly turbulent and ultimately short-lived stint as an amateur politician. And yet this late-stage political misadventure will ultimately become the most widely known, studied, and discussed chapter of Trump's life, much more so than what he was previously already world-famous for. No longer will people think ""businessman"" or ""The Apprentice"" when they hear Donald Trump's name. Instead, the first things that come to mind will be his iron-fisted immigration policies; his promotion of conspiracy theories and falsehoods; his hostility towards all but the most loyal members of his Cabinet, Congress, and the press; his two impeachments, including one brought about after he encouraged his supporters to storm the Capitol; his botched response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the cult of personality that manifested around him because of his unorthodox roots and approach. Maybe they might come to think of his successes with foreign policy and the economy, but these are greatly overshadowed by the long list of controversies that defined his term in the White House.

What, then, will become of Donald John Trump in the years after his presidency? His political tenure is much too important to be treated as just a footnote of his business career, but many Americans may also be interested in quickly forgetting about the national traumas he unleashed and/or exacerbated. It seems as though a doomed fate awaits Donald Trump's legacy, a fate not unlike those you read about in Ancient Greek tragedies... but maybe American academics and historians will find it in their hearts to forgive the former President of his many mistakes. I suppose it all depends on how he acts after leaving the White House; will he be remorseful, regretful, or otherwise haunted by his presidency, or will he continue to defend himself all the way to the grave? I want to watch Donald Trump's post-presidential life very closely, for it will offer much-needed insight into how a man with no political experience thinks and acts when he thrusts himself into the national spotlight and steps out of it a completely changed human being.

I think I will personally miss the chaotic pizzazz that underlined the Trump administration. It may not have been pretty, tidy, or formal in any way, but from an entertainment standpoint, it was incredibly rich and fun to watch, even if stressful as all hell. I know saying that downplays the all-too-real scars that Trump inflicted on the less fortunate people of America, and those should definitely not be ignored, but I believe the next few years will allow time for those scars to heal, even if it happens under the boot of another career politician in Joe Biden.

1038,"Me and my brother fixed minimum wage yesterday while playing Minecraft. (I just need someone to get this to Biden) So this discussion started as an argument(as it always does) about living wages and how changes are going to happen whether we like it or not and how to placate the most people possible. Me and my brother are slight opposites one leaning liberal and one leaning conservative.

Our first agreement was that a 16 year old child in a normal situation (living with their parents) does not necessarily need a living wage to support themselves. We also decided that the minimum wage market is an absolute battle field for people who want to enter the workforce vs. people who need to sustain their lives. Every “adult” that takes a minimum wage job is one less person from the next generation entering the workforce, and that ultimately that will end in redefining when someone is self sufficient enough to be considered an “adult”.

So, we break up minimum wage, while trying to make it simpler than the current system is. It would be a policy set federally but enforced the states. (Preferably designed by a state and adopted nationally... but that would never happen)

Entry Level wage: needs to be though of as a percentage and not an amount!!! If 17% of the current workforce is between the ages of 17-22(a completely made up percentage that felt realistic to my brain) then 17% should should be the maximum amount of minimum wage employees a business can hire. This will be a relatively fixed wage that can only be adjusted through legislation. THIS DOES NOT MEAN 17-22 YEAR OLDS MUST BE PAID LESS. It is simply a way to gauge the demand for entry level jobs.

Living wage: based off of the cost of living in the county the employee works. We were a little hazy on the particulars, but we know that data is fairly accessible and accurate. This is a moving wage that changes annually(?) and automatically. This will both increase the pay for the people who need it, and incentivize businesses to go to places where the cost of living is low, thus building up regions that need it most.

Now, to placate conservatives, this allows both individuals and companies to be successful based on their own work ethic and ability. It rewards them for making the best life choices for themselves. I assume a raised tax would be unavoidable, but not such a high tax increase that the average person feels punished for those who may not have made good decisions. It also give a people a more defined idea of the first few steps to success. Living wage is in between being a kid, and starting a successful career.

To placate liberals, this provides a pay floor for those that need it. The fixed number on entry level jobs will push employers to want to keep their trained workforce at maximum capacity, if you keep rotating your workforce, eventually you will have inexperienced people getting paid more than the entry level position. It will also strengthen the effect of a strike if conditions in that location are sub par.(you can’t be paying untrained scabs more than the bare minimum)

Obviously there are a BUNCH of social/economic issues that this plan doesn’t account for. It’s just what I think is a fix for just a small portion of it.

TL;DR- Break minimum wage into two separate wages. 

Entry level wage: One fixed wage based on the percentage of 16-22 year olds. (If 17% of the population is between 16-22 years of age, then you can only pay 17% of your employees this wage.

Living wage: based on the cost of living in the region, adjusted annually. No restrictions on what percentage of you company can receive this wage.

But after looking at this group, it's clear that this group of self proclaimed libertarians are just a bunch of republicans jerking off to outrage porn about how Joe Biden is actually Joseph Stalin, and that the New World Order is going to harvest their organs and enslave their children or whatever. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that this is part of the reason that nobody in the mainstream takes the libertarian ideology seriously. Libertarians are constantly having to distance themselves from this crowd of driveling right-wingers that think the libertarian platform is the perfect place to ramble about Qanon and how they would like to personally suck Donald Trump Jr's dick.

Like they did with the george flowd riots.  That didn't happen.  Fortunately most conservatives didn't take the bait.  So I think civil war is much more unlikely.  If there is a civil war it will be started by the left.  They wanted the right to start it but they were at least smart enough not to.  The only way I see the right starting a civil war is if irrefutable evidence comes out that biden rigged the election.  Aside from that I think it's very unlikely.  

If there is a civil war it would most likely have to be started by the left.  Groups like antifa were rioting for months last year.  If trump had won the election they wouldn't have handled it nearly as well as the right handled biden winning.  They would burned down most of the major cities.  It would have made the george floyde riots look like a picnic.

Other then that it's very unlikely that there will be a civil war.

1053,"Why I don't agree with voter fraud arguments in the USA as they are currently presented The whole argument by Trump supporters who are claiming there was election fraud is predicated on a few facts:

1) There was fraud in swing states which allowed Biden to win the Presidency

With this argument, we are missing some stuff. The first is this statement is saying there was absolutely no fraud elsewhere, to include states which Trump had won. The second is that if there was any instance of fraud, all of the fraud was to support Biden at the expense of Trump. If someone was wanting to investigate voter fraud because you actually care about voter fraud, you would actually want to investigate the possibility of fraud across all 50 US states, and to consider the possibility some of the voter fraud may have helped Trump, Howie Hawkins, Kanye, or anyone else on the ballot. 

2) There was fraud because votes were counted after midnight

This is implying that an election could theoretically be determined by the speed at which vote counters can vote, not by the actual vote count. This implies the argument does not care about the total amount of votes counted by the entire eligible voter population, but that the timing of the votes matters more. This also implies those arguing this case also do not care about the military personnel who are stationed overseas or serving a campaign on behalf of all of us. If a soldier's vote only counts based on how quickly the USPS can get their vote to a polling station, then perhaps Trump and his supporters actually do not care about soldiers.

3) There was fraud because states had different rules

Isn't the ability for states to set their own laws and regulations and to have a weaker federal government as often stated on the GOP platform (when they actually do discuss policy). If a state had rules which one did not like, and the desire was for the federal government to institute a single voting policy, why not support a constitutional amendment which states what voting rights a person has, and the roles and restrictions states, counties, townships, etc must abide by? Either you are for states rights, or you are not for states rights. Either you want well defined voter rules and regulations, or you do not. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share these observations since I believe the entire argument lacks consistency. Without consistency, there is confusion and a general lack of trustworthiness.",0,0.137,0.765,0.098,-0.9399

Paranoia is the new fad of the left-wing. I saw it first hand; a news reporter on TikTok covering the military presence in Washington for the 17th and on. Droves of paranoid teens saying in the comments that there is a “stillness in the air”, “Washington is quiet... too quiet...”...

Low and behold, nothing happened.

“Fear is linked more often to leaning conservative, whereas feeling safer can lead people to lean more liberal.”

In all fairness, there should be emphasis on “more often” and “can”.

But let’s just look at it for what it is; conservatism— wanting to maintain traditional values— is linked more to fear, whereas liberalism— basically wanting to move the country out of traditional values— is linked more to feeling safer.

I think liberals should know of this, as they are not conducting themselves in a manner so as to legitimize these findings.

The boogeyman for the liberals this past week was some crazy MAGA uprising. Paranoia through the roof, and nothing transpired.

And if it’s not the MAGA boogeyman, it’s the school/mass shooter boogeyman, making them think that this country is in a mass shooting crisis.

And if it’s not the school/mass shooter boogeyman, it’s the racism boogeyman, making them think that systemic racism exists and a return to slavery could be imminent in the new MAGA era.

And if it’s not the racism boogeyman, it’s the police boogeyman, making them think that any instance of an unarmed person getting shot is unjustified, and that there is a problem with racism within policing.

And if it’s not the police boogeyman, it’s the capitalism boogeyman, making them think that all of the evils of the world are innately derivative of capitalism and that light socialism is the solution.

And if it’s not the capitalism boogeyman, it’s the climate change boogeyman, making them think that they’re going to drop dead in 8 years if democrats aren’t in control.

Let’s just abandon this narrative that republicans/conservatives are fueled by fear, and liberals are fueled by their “feeling safe”.

Liberal media reported yesterday that Biden inherited multiple crisis’. This is the state of the Democratic Party. When you walk outside and breathe the fresh air and get some perspective on how blessed you are, there is a raging liberal having a panic attack someone because they have been indoctrinated into believing that the world is falling apart.

After the capital raid I saw a lot of people rushing to say that certain people are a threat to democracy and that they need to be deplatformed, but is democracy really something worth defending? Obviously we don’t want to end up in a dictatorship but how much better is democracy. Currently ~55% of the US population support Biden and left wing policies, and ~35% support Trump. This means under democracy if these 55% decide that the 35% are “threats to democracy” and need to be dealt with, there is nothing legal that the 35% can do to protect themselves. And then I realized why the MSM is so obsessed with democracy, because they can use it to exert power over those who they don’t like very similarly to a dictatorship. 

Some other examples of the fallbacks of democracy include:

Jim Crow laws against blacks before the civil rights era. Blacks had the right to vote back then but being only around 15% of the population their votes meant nothing unless they could get enough of the white population to stop being racist, which took awhile.

Red states where the majority of the population think abortion is murder preventing people who need an abortion from getting one

Covid lockdowns. A majority of the population was scared so they hid away from the virus. Which is fine but then they forced everyone else to abide by those rules.

Vietnam War. 55% of the population wanted to fight in Vietnam, the rest didn’t. Many of those 45% were forced to go to war

All in all, it should be obvious at this point that democracy is a bad system of government, but what should replace it? There are some good aspects of democracy like accountability that are worth keeping. One solution to this is minarchy but that is a very vague solution and I have a better one.

Create a system where: All laws expanding government power require 90% approval to be passed and 10% disapproval to be repealed and all laws restricting government power require 10% approval to be passed and 90% approval to be repealed. For any other laws the normal 50/50 rule applies.

I would also pair this with either a party based election system like they have in England, or direct democracy to replace the legislative branch.

You can raise or lower those percentages depending on how powerful you want government to be, but regardless it would still hold politicians accountable and a majority of 55% could no longer oppress a minority 

I would be careful raising the percentages any more than 95% as that could have some bad consequences like the complete defunding of the military leaving the country defenseless, pedophiles legalizing child exploitation, or if you raise it higher, legalizing theft and murder, the things that is idea is meant to prevent the government from doing.

1111,"The United States Should Give Up On Improved Economy Under Democrat Majority 

 It’s been a week into the newly elected President Biden’s administration, and so far he’s racked up quite the bill on the taxpayers dime; both anticipatory action and via executive order. The highlight of his first week in office focused on the prospect of his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus relief package that lies in wait for the judgement of the newly elected Congress. By now, the rampant government spending is no surprise, as the previous presidential administration also spent $1.9 trillion in stimulus for the CARES Act to combat the virus and provide financial relief to the masses. However; in light of recent events, it’s not about how high the cost is, but where it’s going, who’s getting it, and why it’s a hopeless gesture to argue once the Democrats realize they can push through with their own economic agendas without rejection on the Senate floor. 

 It all begins with the COVID-19 stimulus package; within Biden’s $1.9 trillion “demand”, about 6.8% ($130 billion) is going towards the upkeep of schools during the pandemic. If teacher’s unions around the country (mostly in New Jersey) weren’t already wasting taxpayer dollars NOT doing their jobs and barring the reopening of schools due to COVID, I’d be all for maintaining the schools and COVID-proofing them in hopes of getting those kids back in the classroom. Instead, we’re being forced to shell out our hard-earned cash so the government can take it and say “look, money!”, in an attempt to get those teachers unions to listen. It’s ridiculous, especially since findings have come out outlining the minimal transmission rate of COVID from kids to adults; and teachers are at the front of the line for a vaccine! If it were up to me, I’d withhold that money so that teachers around the country might actually start listening and making plans for a COVID-safe return to schools; but that’s just me.

 The list goes on, of course. At the beginning of the week, President Biden signed the “Buy American” Executive Order to influence citizens to support their local businesses and spend money on American manufactured goods. It’s not a bad thing, but its purpose is utterly useless. 70% of the United States GDP already comes from personal consumption of American manufactured goods; like technology, pharmaceuticals, and medical care. If anything, the purpose of the executive order is to circulate money back into businesses; once again, not a bad thing, just utterly useless when it comes to the fact that many businesses have already been shuttered and “stay-at-home” orders due to COVID are still in effect. 

On the topic of failing businesses due to COVID; Senate Democrats have decided to add insult to injury by pushing forward with their intent to authorize businesses to raise their workers wages to $15/hour no matter the cost. This is an ignorant decision to make; as not only are over 100,000 business around the country shut down for good while we wait for a “life-saving vaccine” for a virus with a 6% mortality rate, but our economy isn’t built to just supply $15/hour wages whenever it wants to. The U.S. economy relies on productivity to determine the amount of wages; basically, their ability to produce more output on a per worker, per hour basis. It’s not always about wealth inequality, and to push an agenda as though it is, only hurts us more in the future. 

Trump was a man-child in the Oval Office, and Biden has expertise; so I admit I’m still holding my breath about him for the most part. But instead of pushing for a liberal agenda while our economy is in a fragile state, maybe the Biden administration should focus more on the matters at hand.

TLDR; I don’t believe politicians until they actually do it. What about you? If you actually look at the Biden admin, they have no many ties to Wall Street.

And it’s worth noting that nobody fucking talked about changes until normal people started winning. So you could view this as politicians finally being enlightened to this problem, or you can see it as politicians wanting to cover wall street’s ass now because they’re already payed off.

1175,"My Thoughts on Nuclear Weapons/Foreign Policy Most Americans have a very distorted view of the threat nuclear weapons pose to their lives. As a matter of fact, cognitive dissonance is almost omnipresent in American perception of military policy. At any moment, a simple computer glitch could cause a mutually-assured destruction style nuclear war to start through no purposeful human action from any political or military leaders. This would cause anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of Americans and billions of other people around the world to die. Such glitches [have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident) occurred before, but were fortunately corrected before war could start. Most estimates of such an event triggering war usually average around 1% a decade.

In their personal lives, most Americans have never known anything other than peace. There haven't been any military battles with a foreign power in the lower 48 states in over 100 years. Not since Pancho Villa attacked New Mexico in 1916. Combine this with the fact that we're all practically indoctrinated from childhood to think that FDR and Woodrow Wilson were good presidents because they got us through the World Wars and that we always need to respect the troops, and you get a hyper-militaristic culture that sees war and violence as the response to any possible aggression against the ""prosperous American way of life"". As a result, when events like 9/11 happen, Americans aren't used to their country being a war zone, so they subsequently have no problem turning other parts of the world into one. Really, any military conflict is seen as some ""patriotic duty"" of America. I guarantee you that right now, Joe Biden could order the bombing of any country in the world, regardless of their current relations with the US, tell Americans we're going to war with them, and within a month, that war would have the support of at least 75% of the population. It doesn't matter which country it is. It could be Iran, Pakistan, Myanmar, Israel, Venezuela, Chile, Belarus, Finland. If you don't believe me, support for military action against Iraq rose from 55% to 80% after the 2003 invasion started. Support for action against Iran rose from 25% to 55% after the killing of Soleimani last year. That's just how screwed up our culture is with regards to foreign policy. This isn't exclusive to military policy either. The war on drugs/mass incarceration are often seen in the same way. It's OK to cause the incalculable suffering of ten of millions of inmates, as long as it's to ""protect freedom and safety"" or whatever.

The way in which this ties into nuclear weapons is that the whole idea of deterrence theory basically uses the American people and billions of other people around the world as a meat shield for the state. It assumes that no political leaders would ever think to bomb another country as long as it means their nation would be destroyed as well. Of course, as we all know, the state couldn't care less for the rights of the people. Politicians insulate themselves by building nuclear bunkers, so they won't ever have to face the consequences of the war they force the rest of us to fight. It's the equivalent of Australian prison ship captains being paid by prisoner, not survival rate. American citizens, of course, are largely none the wiser. They think that events like 9/11 are some of the worst in human history. 9/11 killed about a thousandth of 1% of the US population. In terms of war, those numbers are child's play. The Soviet Union lost 15% of it's population during WWII, Poland lost 17%. In terms of nuclear war, the number are even worse. As mentioned earlier, 50 to 90% of the US population could die in a nuclear war. That's literally 100,000 times more people than died in 9/11. This is in a war that could start at any time due to a computer glitch, that individual world leaders have almost sole authority to start, and the results of which they will be completely insulated from. Consider just how used to peace Americans are, then think about this, and you see just how much cognitive dissonance permeates our thought process with regards to foreign/military policy. The US has literally never fought a war like this in its history. As a matter of fact, wars with this level of death are almost unseen in world history. Even the most brutal conquerors and dictators of centuries past did not wage the wars that modern, first-world politicians would be expected to fight in the event of foreign aggression. Any wars that the US has previously fought pale in comparison. 

Most modern education makes it out to be as if the US just barely managed to eek out a victory in wars like WWI and WWII. WWI was practically over by the time US started military operations. During the time it was in WWII, the US spent almost 10 times as much on the war than it's main rival, Japan did. America lost about 420,000 soldiers over the course of the war, about 0.32% of it's pre-war population. Keep in mind the war death numbers I mentioned earlier. The US was never going to lose WWI or WWII. This is just war propaganda that's be ingrained in our culture over the last 100 years. All getting disproportionately involved in these wars did was set the stage for future conflicts (WWI led to WWII, WWII led to the Cold war). Even during the Civil War, only about 2% of the pre-war US population died, almost all of which were military deaths. Hardly any countries in the world truly want to fight wars if they can avoid them. They see us the exact same way we see them. If we approach military conflicts with proportional response, non-aggression, and free trade to increase the benefits of peace, we can avoid almost all conflicts. No two countries with McDonalds have ever gone to war with each other. We can do better than this.",0,0.245,0.672,0.084,-0.9997

1179,"Did Trump INCITE Violence? Well let’s start with a definition...

Incite: encourage or stir up (violent or unlawful behavior). - Google

Now, there is a STARK difference between inciting something, and causing something.

Cause: a person or thing that gives rise to an action, phenomenon, or condition. - Google

The difference is clear.

Inciting something puts responsibility on you. “Blame”. Causing something does not.

Let’s take a school shooter for example. His mother birthing him is partly what caused the school shooting to happen. If there was no birth, the kid would not have grown up and inevitably shot a school up. Get it? A bully at school picking on little Timmy caused the school shooting to happen, as that was the final straw that made him snap. Did the bully INCITE the school shooting? Is shoving little Timmy into a locker encouraging him to commit a heinous act in shooting up a school? Little Timmy’s mom caused the school shooting in part by simply birthing him and possibly raising him poorly, but did she necessarily ENCOURAGE him to shoot up a school?

So let’s relate this back to Trump...

Trump CAUSED January 6th to happen. He set the date and organized the protest at the Capitol. If he did not organize a protest there, nobody would have gathered, nobody would have went to the building and nobody would have broken in. In that same light, Trump’s dad having sexual intercourse (sex) with Trump’s mom inevitably caused January 6th to happen. If father Trump hadn’t blown out mother Trump’s back, Trump wouldn’t have existed, wouldn’t have ran for president, would have won and would have organized a protest. The first homosapien 200,000 years ago having sex (intercourse) led to the events that inevitably led to January 6th. Actually, if the Big Bang never happened, neither would January 6th. Basically, the natural order of time, progression and the butterfly effect basically incriminate everything for having caused January 6th. That does NOT mean that the Big Bang, or an early homo sapien, or Trump’s dad or Trump himself should have any responsibility for what happened even if they caused it by definition. Heck, even Biden caused January 6th. If he never win, there would never have been a protest and January 6th would never have happened. That doesn’t mean Biden is responsible, right?

Now, Trump did cause January 6th, as did Osama Bin Laden, George Washington and King Tut. Did Trump INCITE the events? By that, I mean did he ENCOURAGE ILLEGAL ACTS TO BE TAKEN? You tell me. Make sure to cite your sources. I am very interested in seeing where Trump told anyone to commit a crime.

Short answer: Sleepy Joe is in China’s back pocket and won’t do jack shit. He’s not recognizing Vietnam or whatever as its own country (might not be Vietnam) and has vocally went against what China is doing as the new president.

When did Joe Biden take accountability for writing the crime bill? He didn’t, corn pop.

When did Joe Biden take accountability when he said that if you don’t vote for him, that you ain’t black? He didn’t take acoun— you-you- you know, the thing.

When did Joe Biden take accountability when he said he would protect oil workers and jobs but he got rid of the pipeline? He d-d-didn’t.

When did Joe Biden take accountability for being a part of the administration that created the cages at the southern border? C’mon man! He didn’t!

I started asking myself, ""Where would you draw the line?"" On the one hand, I don't think businesses should be able to deny service based on race. On the other, I think about that cake shop that denied service to a gay couple, and I think that should be okay - not because they're gay, exactly, but because making cakes could be considered an artistic endeavor and you shouldn't ever force someone to make art that they don't want to.

And I think I know how they are going to try it.  The want to have a civil war so that foreign countries have an excuse to send in their militaries to occupy america.  I think what they are going to do is try to pain trump as the bad guy as much as possible.  While having biden rachet up the tyranny.  Or at least have him piss off conservatives.  Then they stage something to get the war started and both sides fighting each other. Once both sides have worn each other down they send in foreign troops.  If they just send in foreign troops there would be a unified  response to kick them out of the country.  But if they start a civil war and destablize the us then they have an excuse to send in foreign troops.  

This is when you will likely see foreign troops go door to door confiscating guns.  After they have broken society down with a civil war and foreign occupation they will build it back with a staged alien invasion to unify everyone under their flag against the aliens.  Once they have foreign troops on american soil and have confiscated guns then you will see the real oppression start.  So people on the left and the right you are being played.

I've seem on Twitter a bunch of Republicans trying to take there bidens words context during his speech the other day when talking about uyghurs. Even though he condemned China for the treatment of the Muslim minority.

It got me thinking ""why are Republicans getting involved in this topic anyway""? They never showed any sympathy for innocent muslims or any group endangered out side of their country.  I realize they probably never cared about uyghur muslims in the first place. They're probably only getting involved because its china and they want to look like ""heroes"" or ""foreign conservative saviors"". When it comes to places like Africa or the Philippines it gets no attention, but when it comes to communist only places like Venezuela and china they got their attention. Liberals seem to actually  try and help people,  while conservatives only going thing to gain some benefits from it.  Do you agree? 


Also For context   Biden was talking about how china plays victim when outside countries points out the terrible stuff they do. He also brings up how they're unified by discriminating one group or blaming minorities. This is common thing when it come totalitarian governments. Lastly  he trys compare leadership and cultures  of America and china. Like how the president of china is not talking about or bringing up the horrible acts towards the uyghurs.  Also it remind me how north koreans culture mostly focused on the destruction of America and seeing us as villians, because their government brainwashed their citizens.",0,0.112,0.761,0.126,0.5106
1227,"Green and Gold? Would ya'll ever consider working with the Greens to win a national election?

Hear me out, both parties have a similar emphasis on government accountability and protection/expansion of social freedoms. Both parties appeal to voters who feel that the two major parties are corrupt and tone deaf. And while individually a vote for either party is more or less a vote of protest or no confidence, voters might be more likely to vote for a bloc of the two most popular 'third parties.' In fact, if the Democrats and Republicans keep running candidates like Trump and Biden a Green-Libertarian coalition might actually win.

The problem is, of course, that there are some massive differences in Green and Libertarian strategies. Greens are known for supporting strong environmentalist policies, of course, and also supporting a strong social safety net and Democrat-style government programs. The Libertarian Party, on the other hand, favors market solutions in the form of deregulation as well as shrinking government and lowering taxes.

My take is that this is actually a good thing. Why not have two parties who are fundamentally more concerned about individual rights and reforming government than the two major parties work together to balance market and government solutions to economic and environmental problems? Honestly, while I definitely prefer the LP over the Green Party, I think both parties are too extreme to work effectively in our current system. If both sides compromised you could easily end up with a more palatable platform than that of the Republicans or Democrats. For instance a pro-2A, pro-choice platform with lower taxes paid for through lower military spending, a simplified tax structure, a healthcare voucher system for those who can't afford insurance, large incentives for sustainability in the private sector and shrinking of federal policing and surveillance bodies (just one possible combination of Libertarian and Green ideology).

Keep in mind, at the inception of our country the vice president was the person who had received the second highest vote. This would mean that the vice president was expected to be someone with significantly different views than the president, and I believe that is a fundamentally sound concept. The parties could temporarily combine on the ballot and run a primary with candidates from both sides, and have the highest vote-getter as the presidential candidate with the highest vote-getter of the other party background as the VP. They could run for reelection in four years with the understanding that the current VP/VP candidate would be the presidential candidate on the party's next run. After an eight year run the combined party could repeat the process to pick new candidates.",0,0.032,0.762,0.206,0.9976

1255,"metaphor for us politics  I have come with a sound analogy (in my opinion) for the state of American mid covid crisis politics;

the scene:

mass unemployment

growing welfare cheques being cashed

huge rises in unemployment rises of 800k a month in the US month on month even in the last so called recovery months

every  economic marker in the red GDP, production, sales, debt at the highest  every to gdp, inflation is as flat as a pancake (show a completely  stagnant economy no consumption no production )

we  are heading towards a VERY DANGEROUS CLIFF WHERE covid government  unemployment cheques are tailing off in mid march and some even before  this some of which it is already coming to an end in a week and wont be  able to be averted.

Politics  in the US is headed towards a huge cliff, where if they get this wrong  and act too late there will be a huge crash economically within 2-3  months, where their inaction directly exacerbated the crash.

The metaphor:

American  politics eg the senate congress and lead by biden, is in car all of  them and the country of america is headed STRAIGHT AT A HUGE CLIFF, they  know the cliff is coming they know they have to stop the car getting to  the cliff by applying the brakes. Their concern first is not to apply  the brakes, but everyone is jostling to get to the DRIVING WHEEL IN THE  DRIVERS SEAT SO THEY CAN BE SEEN APPLYING THE BRAKES FIRST. The longer  the jostling the less attention is being paid TO THE CLIFF THEY ARE  MOVING TOWARDS AT GREAT SPEED.

As you see the problem IT DOESNT MATTER IF YOUR IN THE DRIVING SEAT IF THE CAR IS GOING DOWN THE CLIFF, ALL BETS ARE OFF

Explanation:

the  car is easy to understand as is the cliff parts, the jostling part is  concerned with the complete lack of urgency in passing the aid budget  and the concern with pathetic party political points scoring balls, eg  Biden own picks, and the Trump trial of impeachment. The complete  miscalculation of urgency is pathetic, the only thing that matters now  is the passing of the bill, everything else is tiny in comparison its  not even close.

Coupled with this the lack of urgency they had a fucking recess nothing was done in congress last week, IN THE MIDDLE OF COVID.

**Have you ever been at home, relaxing, in your pajamas, watching a football game, not hurting a fly, heard a knock at the door, and gotten up to answer it…and looked up to an AR-15 and shotgun pointed at your face and head…by sheriff’s deputies?**

**Have you ever been beaten, stomped on, tazered, tortured and subjected to a fate worse than death by sadistic law enforcement officers despite having harmed nobody, having no interest in harming anyone, no history of violence or criminal activity beyond a couple parking tickets sometime in the previous two decades and though no saint, no criminal act any jury would convict and imprison any citizen for in any state…except for opposing corruption in backroom deals in a county with a history and “culture of corruption.”**

**Congress, if it has a shred of integrity, a shred of honor, must decline Merrick Garland’s nomination as the wrong choice for A.G. at a time when a no-corruption, pro-justice, dedicated reformer intent on eliminating the rampant institutional corruption that dominates every office and action within the U.S. Justice Dept. and prevents any initiative to substantively reform broken criminal justice and policing organizations and SOPs, and training and oversight, at the local level from coast-to-coast.**

**Corrupt local governments, prosecutors, judicial and law enforcement officials have operated free from any accountability or interest in upholding the Rule of Law and American ideals of justice and the rights and liberties of citizens for far too long, while too many innocent people were tortured and tormented, deprived of liberty, property, careers, livelihoods, civil rights, legal protections, Constitutional rights and liberties, and basic human decency.**

**I know what it is like to be attacked by a media establishment devoid of any ethics, integrity or even a semblance of minimal human decency for the crime of opposing corruption and being the first and only official to monitor the numerous concealed legal settlements costing taxpayers millions of dollars every month – almost all the result of sadistic violent misconduct by law enforcement.**

**My life was not merely threatened. I was subjected to approx. 80 illegal and violent detentions to intimidate and prevent my exercising the solemn duty to represent the people as I was elected to do and did as consistently as possible with my pledges made in the process of campaigning, which I did even when doing so was contrary to my best interests or literally dangerous – not in theory but deliberate and premeditated retaliation for threatening what the FBI called a “culture of corruption” – the D.A. made it known (recording provided to FBI) that no matter what the crime, if I was murdered, under no circumstances would his office investigate or prosecute any party involved…**

**…and the crimes were frequent, increasingly savage, including assaults, being threatened by 12 sheriff’s deputies in my pajamas in my home watching Sunday night football, more than 10 AR-15s and shotguns pointed at my face and head, finger on trigger, and several inches from my sweet golden retriever’s head as his life was threatened as well for the crime of expressing “dissent” – advocating reforms such as mitigating totally criminal embezzlement in Wilmington’s head start program, where funds intended for education and nutrition for the most disadvantaged children was diverted to the personal bank account of the executive director and her five best friends, with the corrupt D.A. Ben David and equally sadistic, homicidal, deceitful, pal sheriff Ed McMahon, one of numerous serious crimes the FBI was fully aware of and clear a conviction at trial would have been a virtual certainty.**

**As an elected official I was beaten, attacked, threatened, tortured (by law enforcement) slandered, mocked, defamed, called everything under the sun for being uncompromising in opposing corruption and promoting justice and liberty and equality, alone, as no other official of any gender, race, creed, or party affiliation shared these priorities, and at the time police reform and criminal justice reform were not cool and I was surrounded by officials, black, white, men, women, dem, rep., more interested in real estate deals and their self-interests, even the NC NAACP, ACLU, etc.. didn't care about police brutality or the epidemically broken criminal justice system at the time. so, the ACLU of NC and NAACP, SPLC, ADL, none cared as the sadism and brutality and deaths grew without media or public activist interest.**

**I was the only official who even monitored these secretive settlements of lawsuits, 90-percent of which involved law enforcement misconduct and extreme violence and rights violations from law enforcement misconduct and brutality incidents. nobody else in public office even monitored these concealed lawsuit settlements or the criminal misconduct occurring with great frequency, and many times, death of totally harmless persons of all races and the costly lawsuits for taxpayers resulting from total public official indifference.**

**Every month the County was settling approx. 12 lawsuits every month stemming from sadistic violence often resulting in death or permanent injuries to unarmed, vulnerable victims rarely guilty of any crime rising beyond misdemeanor or guilty of no crime at all, victims of all races and ages.**

**It is long past time to hold corrupt government, judicial and law enforcement officials accountable for corruption and criminal misconduct. There can be no real notion of justice in the epidemic, systemically broken “justice system,” with District Attorneys like New Hanover county, NC’s Ben David, his corrupt mentor and crony former attorney general (and current NC governor) Roy Cooper, and the U.S. DOJ and FBI which have almost without exception violated their mission, defiled justice, civil and Constitutional rights, and assisted in public corruption and sadistic acts of brutality and violence, against even law-abiding citizens.**

**The same number of times each month, approx. 12, I would be harassed in my car or home by six or more members of law enforcement with ar-15s and shotguns pointed at my face, beatings, threats, even my dog, a golden retriever named ""boomer"" had a gun pointed at his head as a deputy threatened both our lives. the terror, threats and violence from law enforcement, directed by district attorney ben David, documented for the FBI, which was in collusion and protecting D.A. Ben David along with his pal, then North Carolina AG, now Gov. Roy Cooper, would escalate to more pronounced violence, torture and worse as well as death threats and false imprisonment to keep me, an elected official, from carrying out my duties to represent the voters who put me in office in the first place.**

**When will enough be enough?**

**I was often stalked, harassed 8-12 times per mo. by dozens of deputies, lights flashing, just for sitting in my vehicle texting constituents. no crimes of course. death threats, multiple incidents of loaded guns pointed at my face, head, threats to kill my dog “boomer,” were common.**

**Individual kooks buy into crazy conspiracy theories on the Internet, but it is the tyrannical, intolerant, hate-fueled deceit and manipulative subversion of freedom and democracy, transparency and integrity, by government officials protected by the U.S. DOJ &amp; FBI, who have contributed to such conspiratorial thinking by becoming so deranged with hatred that even once common lip service paid to “journalistic ethics” and “factual reporting” has been completely and unapologetically thrown in the trash, doused in gasoline and set ablaze – the propaganda, intolerance of differences, hatred and evil intent of media and big tech and government and academia and wall street is far worse and more pervasive than any Nazi book burning and its getting even more extreme and intolerant. Members of Congress like Speaker Pelosi, Jason Crowe and AOC have advocated Stalin-style purges and retribution instead of modeling their conduct and agendas after champions of freedom and justice and statesmanship.**

**Garland’s testimony indicates every intention of repeating the mistakes of the past when the FBI burned and murdered with cowardly snipers innocent women and children under the guise of addressing a crisis of “domestic terrorism,” “white supremacists” and “gun-toting militias” after very few incidents and very poor conduct and communication by Justice Dept. and FBI officials –**

**– similar to the conduct of those agency’s in recent years and practically identical to the inexcusable incompetence and misguided judgement of the corrupt Bureau and DOJ brass preceding January 6th – another reason for Congress to demand a competent authentic reformer – which Garland is clearly NOT.**

**He is simply not the right choice for this moment in time when visionary, ethical leadership is so necessary and more important than trying to make amends for the perceived slight of the past when he was a nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.**

**Past wrongs should not be righted at the expense of American justice and liberty, the Rule of Law, and the Constitutional rights, civil rights, human rights and lives and legal protections of American citizens.**

**I was willing to get pummeled and tasered without moving my hands from straight at my sides because if you so much as flinch or try to shield your face, law enforcement will shoot you dead without remorse, without a pang of conscience or humanity. and they made it clear under the barrel of numerous ar-15s and shotguns that they would gladly kill me and were planning on it, and they meant it. they threatened to shoot my golden retriever too.**

**I do not support ""defunding. I do support liberty and justice and the human rights of all my countrymen...and anyone who experiences anything like what I was subjected too is usually left, if they live, with permanent scars and PTSD and an uncompromising mission to try to raise awareness by sharing our stories so nobody else endures the suffering caused every day, esp. in black and brown communities but white families too, sadists rarely limit their victims...anyone vulnerable who they can abuse.**

**It has gone on too long. destroyed too many lives and families, tell them to fix what should’ve been fixed decades ago – end the institutional corruption that has corrupted and defiled justice, liberty, equality, aided by the U.S. DOJ &amp; FBI responsible for preventing &amp; prosecuting these sick crimes and brutality that has become epidemic.**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**Support for Merrick Garland is an assault on Justice, Freedom and democracy. It is a carte blanche to make the institutionally corrupt and criminal, murderously inclined for political self-interests Department of Justice and FBI more political, corrupt, lawless and indifferent to America lives, justice, transparency, the Constitution, civil rights and human rights with the most dangerously political Attorney General in decades, a more extreme and indifferent bigot and enemy of justice than Eric Holder, and the laundry list of Attorney Generals dating back decades who have neglected their stated jurisdiction and responsibilities for providing oversight, protections, investigation and when appropriate, prosecutions of criminal misconduct by local law enforcement and public officials.**

**Tell Congress to amicably vote “Nay on Garland” AND pursue public corruption mitigation to ensure that the U.S. Constitution, laws and civil rights, and human rights are not disregarded and ignored by corrupt State and local governments, criminal justice and law enforcement agencies and officials when (as in North Carolina) State and local officials are too corrupt, deceitful, conspiratorial, prejudicial or sadistic, greedy or otherwise inclined to abuse the powers of their office(s) or agency to respect the laws and rights of citizens and uphold the U.S. Constitution. Protect and defend the democratic process and protect human life and justice, and liberty.**

**Merrick Garland has made it clear that he has no such intention, rather he has expressed the most political and dangerous, justice-indifferent agenda in modern American political history. He has expressed the most discriminatory, prejudicial, lawless, corrupt ideological agenda in decades, heralding the same misguided support for a broken, corrupt and unjust criminal justice system and law enforcement organizations just as epidemically corrupt.**

**Congress, if it has a shred of integrity, a shred of honor, must decline Garland’s nomination as the wrong choice for A.G. at a time when a no-corruption, pro-justice, dedicated reformer intent on eliminating the rampant institutional corruption that dominates every office and action within the U.S. Justice Dept. and prevents any initiative to substantively reform broken criminal justice and policing organizations and SOPs, and training and oversight, at the local level from coast-to-coast.**

**In lieu of appointing the most extreme advocate of government criminality in memory, Garland, Congress ought to investigate, hold hearings, and hold accountable and prosecute, if appropriate under statute, those officials who have engaged in prosecutorial or judicial misconduct or police brutality, and public corruption that has cost taxpayers millions every month while being concealed from them, and by far the most costly and evil is the epidemic law enforcement brutality, and murders, and deprivations of liberty and justice that destroys lives, families, communities and causes indescribable damage to human souls.**

**This must end. It’s long past time for Congress to spend a fraction of the time and energy devoted to corruption and personal hatreds and vindictive plots against President Trump or anyone who doesn’t join the leftist, goose-stepping intolerant narcissistic bigots and elitists of the unethical, manipulative and deceitful mainstream media, Big Tech and even some Members of Congress.**

**Support for Garland is support for continued police and District Attorney violations of the law, corruption, deceit, and systemic, sadistic violence and murder that includes torture, murders and deprivations against people of all races, genders, political affiliations and even ages as both children and grandparents are fair game for murder with NO integrity, accountability, transparency or oversight as Garland made clear he has no intention of enforcing those laws and policies the US Dept. of Justice, Civil Rights Division and FBI claim as part of their mission and under their statutory authority despite decades of neglect. In fact, these agencies have murdered in cold blood completely innocent men, women, even children…**

**Garland has made it clear that the burning alive of children and mother’s being shot in the face while holding their babes as has too often occurred is more acceptable and likely to be Biden-Harris policy. Both the President and V.P. have, with all do respect, built their entire careers creating and implementing such policies while supporting the same collusion and protection for criminal prosecutors and homicidal law enforcement and all forms of public corruption that serves extreme, pandering political ends that ultimately boil down to self-interest at the expense of democracy, human life, justice and the law.**

**A vote to confirm Merrick Garland is highly-likely to become blood on the hands – the hands of those Members of Congress who support criminal misconduct “under Color of Law” and given the conduct of the US Dept of Justice and FBI for decades, with the direct cold-blooded murders of dozens of children, white and black, and total aid and support for prosecutorial and policing sadism and homicides with NO accountability by State and local officials.**

**Reforms and effort to fix such institutional corruption and abuses of power is clearly not on the Biden Administration radar and Garland has made clear that he (and Congress should it support such a deceptive and political AG) has every intention of doing NOTHING to investigate, and prosecute, the criminals who dominate District Attorney and judicial offices, State and local governments and their corrupt cronies in law enforcement who systemically abuse citizens and deprive the law-abiding of the most basic human and civil rights, defile justice and defecate on liberty and lives without remorse or accountability.**

**None of this is new. Biden and Harris have spent their entire lives NEVER wavering from championing the most heinous acts of injustice and brutality imaginable and the appointment of Garland to be Attorney General of the United States is a direct reflection of their intention to continue to pursue the corruption and sociopathic motives that they have both championed without exception or human decency at any point prior to 2020 and a pandering, hate-fueled, race-baiting disingenuous campaign for the White House and selfish ambitions that have no basis in real criminal justice and policing reforms for ALL citizens regardless of race and political agendas – as Garland clearly articulated the latter to be his primary mission once appointed.**

**Garland claimed he would be apolitical while contradictorily stating the most political mission and anti-justice policy intentions of any nominee for Attorney General in the past half century perhaps, and articulated a Goebbels’s style propaganda model barely veiling his intention to advanced discriminatory application of the Law, civil discord, public corruption, and opposition to reforms long overdue to end the Justice Department and FBI’s role in promoting and aiding the very criminal misconduct those Federal agencies are charged with investigating and prosecuting.**

**It is simply disingenuous to claim that the US government and public institutions including the mainstream media are remotely factual and ethical or that any real substantive or ethical distinction between historic media organizations and the darkest, worst aspects of ""social media"" exists in regards to integrity, ethics, trustworthiness or moral purpose -**

**IN FACT, the worst social media ""hoaxes"" are no less honest or more dangerous than the sinister, racist, hate-fueled, deceptively manipulative sociopathic intentions from Good Morning America and ABC's racist unethical lies disguised to ""look"" like news - like the ""Post-Ethics"" institutions of law enforcement, government agencies, Congress, and education, the reality of once trusted institutions is no more credible than the craziest social media conspiracy theories.**

**–Mere days before January 6th, I reached out to Rep. Jason Crowe’s Office and the Colorado Congressman, turned Drama Queen despite being protected and safe at all times, like AOC despite her apparent inability to tell the truth, according to some close colleagues, or empathize with those who have ACTUALLY had death threats, made at gunpoint, from serious perpetrators (with badges) because of political motives. In my own case these started as written communications, escalated to recorded messages, and in my case, despite significant, irrefutable evidence the responsible leader of a premeditated, organized campaign of terror, violence, sadistic brutality and torture, and worse, not to mention dozens of property crimes…**

**…Approximately 80 extreme, totally unlawful acts of illegal stalking, intimidation by dozens of uniformed law enforcement officers with deadly weapons and more aggressive, excessively violent, overwhelmingly dramatic and heavily armed, platoons of violent, finger-on-trigger squads with 10-12 or more assaultive, bullying militarized officers, using numerous vehicles, lights flashing, sirens blaring, for intimidation or to create as much out of the ordinary attention and extreme show of force to not merely threaten and intimidate and punish political action consistent with political statements articulated while campaigning and considered beyond compromise, esp. opposition to historic corruption and secrecy behind closed doors that has long defined political and government activities and policies in the Cape Fear region and Wilmington, NC.**

**DA Ben David and Rep. Ted Davis planned prior to my taking the Oath of Office – unknown to me at the time but later revealed by Wilmington, N.C. Mayor Bill Saffo, because of my campaigning and practice without compromise once in office, to pursue pledges made during the campaign, notably my uncompromising, not for sale at any price, opposition to corruption and representation of ordinary citizens and taxpayers traditionally ignored and even despised by local officials and their profiteering, corrupt cronies who enjoyed almost total power with no opposition at all, what the FBI called in the 1980s a “Culture of Corruption in Southeast North Carolina,” a tradition nobody dared challenge before I did so…**

**At least in the previous 100 years when a group calling themselves the White Supremacists succeeded in the only Coup d’état in American history. In 1898, the region’s leading families and patriarchs since the pre-Civil War days violently murdered or ran out of town, never to return, the white Republicans and successful members of perhaps the most advanced, skilled and cosmopolitan black communities at the end of the 19th Century, those who didn’t flee for their lives were in large numbers machine gunned and slaughtered – the Cape Fear River turned red with the blood of the murdered free black citizens and sympathetic white Republicans, who were robbed of all property even if they were lucky enough to escape with their lives as so many perished in continuous hail of bullets, fires, and the orgy of murder and violence…so clear was the statement made that its intended impact lasted more than a Century, continues to influence the region, those who led the Coup d’état overthrowing the government remain the most influential, affluent and patriarchal citizens of Wilmington to this day.**

**Nobody else would dare the stupid risks I was willing, and stupidly, committed too and there’s no company, no support groups, no State or Federal officials including then Attorney General and current N.C. Governor Roy Cooper, then Gov. Pat McCrory, US DOJ or FBI officials, and a small, fake, unethical, virtually non-existent local media.**

**Members of Congress who suddenly cared about democracy and political violence on January 6, 2021 – not a day prior - would between them asked a total of zero questions, not one ever inquired even casually asking others whether there was any truth to my statements made under penalty of perjury, not one even asked if I was okay or expressed any interest in the corruption and systemic abuses and crimes that the U.S. government has long known permeates Southeastern NC.**

**The U.S. DOJ and FBI under Eric Holder possessing many years of evidence and knowledge, supplemented by hundreds of documents, recorded conversations, and far more extensive admissible evidence handed right into the arms of the government than I provided, only to learn that the Gov. Cooper, N.C. State Bureau of Investigations, U.S. DOJ, FBI and politicians with the ability to act are in reality so close to DA Ben David, who stated that even if I “was murdered in broad daylight,\[he would\] never investigate or prosecute anybody for any crime committed against me” without exception including murder. This is government, this is law enforcement, this is criminal justice, in North Carolina.|**

**North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein and Governor Cooper are respectively D.A. Ben David’s mentor and prodigy, all in line to become Governor of the State in the future, and the FBI and DOJ are so close that they are not only in collusion with this corruption, but actively aid and protect prosecutorial misconduct “Under Color of Law” and police brutality, and homicides, as a standard protocol without exception, ever.**

**I’ll never take a knee during my national anthem, but nobody has been a more active, genuine, singularly focused advocate for criminal justice and policing reforms than I have been for more than a decade, including the NAACP and ACLU and black and white elected officials and police and community leaders who’s hatred of President Trump is matched only perhaps by their completely non-existent interest in justice reform or opposing rather than supporting police brutality – this was true both publicly and behind closed doors.**

**In four years not one political official in one meeting, white or black, Republican or Democrat, ever even said the word “justice,” let alone advocated or inquired about routine brutality and murders disproportionately impacting black and brown community members. They were far more interested in discussing real estate deals and their success as career politicians and law enforcement brass if not Federal agents supports that priority whereas I was beaten and tortured to the point of having to relearn how to talk, have irreversible neurological damage, and was robbed of nearly everything, left homeless in a car with a dead battery after being convinced to leave, finally, with a gun to my head and a serious promise that if I did not leave I would be lynched.**

**Though I was threatened many times prior to that night, with more AR-15s and shotguns inches from my head and face, and guns to my golden retriever’s head too. No doctor in town would take me s a patient, which mattered esp. because I was experiencing seizures at that time, simply going to a doctor’s office would be an invitation for the media to show up. Nobody would rent an apartment to me even after seeing my name despite being quite willing before hearing my name, and even with a full-year paid upfront once they learned my name the conditional and cheerful approval became a flat “no.”**

**To this day, while Jussie Smollett is praised and receives the hugs, adoration and Barbara Walters specials from Robin Roberts and the media not a single so-called journalist has ever even once asked me “are you okay” and never asked one question, out of about 1000 reporters, not one asked even one question about this elected official being truly, genuinely threatened with murder at gunpoint, and beaten, tortured, subjected to things I can’t and never have discussed and trauma, well, I have to live with it because nobody has experienced anything remotely similar, and AOC and Jason Crowe’s indifference just days before Jan 6th when I had contact with Crowes team…**",0,0.208,0.664,0.128,-1.0

In the 1800’s it was commonly believed that agriculture was the best way to create personal wealth in the world. This wasn’t necessarily true but people have glamorized farming throughout world history and when centralized governments rise the first sector of industry turned public is typically agriculture. Governments have incentives to control people and there is no easier way to achieve that goal than reward them for their loyalty by feeding them.

One of the greatest examples of such an event occurred during Stalin’s rise to power in the U.S.S.R., through a manipulation tactic borrowed from other great world leaders. Stalin began his sovietization of the country through rural farmers by instilling fear in his citizens. He sent his loyalists from community to community warning the towns of the Kulaks, and making sure everyone in the town were weary of these people. It was absolutely essential to Stalin’s regime that these Kulaks were taken care of and he promised his citizens he would re-educate them through concentration camps and other forms of force and intimidation.

So who were the Kulaks and why did Stalin want to rid them of society so bad? Were they ethnically different than other Russians, or spoke a separate native tongue? These were questions individuals around the country were asking themselves and their neighbors. Over a short period of time the fear of these people spread like wildfire throughout the countryside. The fear turned so sour that if an argument broke out the accusation that you were a Kulak was thrown around, you might just find yourself trucked to a new forever home based on an anonymous tip your neighbor left to the government.

Meanwhile Stalin was reforming the idea of ownership of private land, creating communal farming structures that led to starvation and nationwide food shortages. The country was frenzied by the fear of the Kulaks, blinded to the sweeping reform and depression into collectivism that was being decided by the real threat to the country, the leadership. Instead of questioning the people with power in the society, the citizens turned on each other, their neighbors of being Kulaks, cancelled their existence.

Usually a nation has existed because the people in proximity to each other live so similarly they may as well engage in a governmental society. However, the U.S. is different, we rose out of rebellion and focused on how the people could live without being controlled by a government. The Russian Kulaks are not the only example of citizens turning on each other, in fact the cancel culture is a common feature of many doomed societies. With the cancel culture being so prevalent today, is there reason to believe something more terrifying may be happening in society?

Americans have long prided themselves on their first amendment right. It has been considered a bedrock principal for a long time but is facing attack by not only society, but by government as well. President Biden has stated his intention to install a “Minister of Truth” to decide what news channels should cover as “real” news and what should be considered “fake” news. Such a concept didn’t use to exist, debate would occur to uncover the truth but without debate we have nothing other than propaganda.

The cancel culture has arisen out of a lack of curiosity in our country, partisan tension is a good thing but what makes individuals free is the ability to come to their own conclusion. When people are so convinced they are correct about the world around them they refuse to engage in debate and in turn are unable to change their mind. This mentality leads to believing that everyone with any form of dissent is evil. Most Americans want what they believe is best for the country moving forward and if we ever hope to reach any type of consensus we need to be willing to accept dissenting opinions and realize that we will not agree with everything we hear.

I therefore present a challenge, never cancel. The fear of hearing dissent doesn’t lead to better outcomes but a willingness to engage in debate can lead to the truth. Be curious in life and attempt to find truth at all cost, no matter the fear that comes from exploring the unknown.

Now it sounds an awful lot like r/politics around here lately.

Lately,  if you aren’t pushing left wing agendas, then you get down-voted and gas-lighted by leftist trolls.

All I have to say is Ron Paul was the best presidential candidate of all time and he inspired me to look into this party and seriously consider joining back in 2008 and 2012.

And the pro-Biden semi-communist bullshit is driving me insane lately in the sub.

Libertarians are independents who lean left socially, but right on financial issues.

“Socially liberal and fiscally conservative” has been my motto... and that’s now become just “liberally liberal and if you don’t like it you’re not a Libertarian because liberal is the root of the word.”  Which is bullshit because “Liberty” is the actual root of the word.

If I get banned for saying this then so be it.  It was nice knowing you all.

* $213 billion on retrofitting and building affordable housing and
* $100 billion to expand broadband access, among other investments.
* Would raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%
* Eliminates Oil and Gas tax benefits
* Focuses primarily on climate change, not the backlog of projects
* Seeks to build 500,000 affordable housing units while eliminating ""exclusionary zoning laws""

Just because I recognize the horse cock about to be shoved up my ass, doesn't mean I want to go back to the gorilla cock lubed in hot sauce.

So here is the summary contents of the proposed package: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/31/upshot/whats-in-bidens-infrastructure-plan.html?searchResultPosition=2

There's a lot wrong with this. Some good, but a lot of just shit. The big one that really gets under my skin is the claim that they're going to fix 20k miles of road and another 10k bridges. Big numbers, right? Well, there are over 500k miles of road, 160k of highways, and over 40k miles interstate alone. And there is well over a million bridges in this country. 115B in bridges and roads, like 1/20th the proposed bill, and almost half of all roads in the u.s (on average, in some states its 70%) are in disrepair.

https://www.busbud.com/blog/the-state-of-americas-roads/

Buildings and utilities is a bit less as awful. The big take away is high speed broadband infrastructure and 5G infrastructure. This is coupled with a political trifecta that is very hostile towards the internet monopolies. These two factors should see a brake up of some internet monopolies and a pretty good expansion of competition in the industry as 5G should theoretically reduce the barrier to entry now.

Another positive take away is funding to finally phase out the lead piping in the country. The proposed amount should be enough to nullify this issue. And I think that's because this is a real sticking point for black communities, and thus sort of important for solidifying their base.

The jobs and innovation package is basically small change and I'd wager just something for Republicans to chew up and spit out for the purpose of baiting in bipartisan support. It's a lot of vague waste that I don't think the deficit hawks are going to like.

Frustratingly, they included 400B for health care... which really makes it clear where their agenda is heading towards. It's an indicator of a national healthcare policy in my opinion. This is just one of those things, like race, that they're going to have to just drag out in every policy decision.",0,0.093,0.8,0.107,0.9066

1410,"If you support vaccine passports 'as long as private corporations are the ones doing it' then your beliefs couldn't be further from that of left-libertarianism. It's bizarre to me just how willing to accept government and corporate led restrictions those who describe themselves as 'left libertarian' on here are.  The most bizzare thing is watching as 'left libertarians' throw what they feel are right libertarian arguments back in their faces as some sort of 'gotcha' moment in defense of these.  The vaccine passport conversation has been especially eye opening on this front.  The number of 'left libertarians' or 'libertarian socialists' I've seen declare that restricting movement and access to everyday services through the use of vaccine passports is not only OK but a net positive so long as it's only private corporations requiring them is astounding.   Since when did you guys start viewing the concentration of power by private companies as a good thing?  

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Definition)

&gt;While right-libertarianism refers to *laissez-faire* capitalism such as Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism and Robert Nozick's minarchism, socialist libertarianism ""view\[s\] any concentration of power into the hands of a few (whether politically or economically) as antithetical to freedom and thus advocate for the simultaneous abolition of both government *and* capitalism."" 

Where in this ideology does it even hint that you should be supporting vaccine passports so long as they're dictated by private corporations?  Here is what the federal government is currently doing in regards to vaccine passports as outlined in recent articles: 

&gt; President Joe Biden's administration is working to establish a set of standards for people to prove they've been vaccinated against Covid-19, an administration official [said last Sunday](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/28/politics/biden-administration-vaccination-passport/index.html).   
&gt;  
&gt;The official said the White House is working with government agencies, tech companies and non-profit organizations to plan and coordinate the effort, which is likely weeks away from being finalized. 

Government agencies, tech companies, and major non-profits are all entities that command a significant amount of power in the hands of relatively few people.  There is nothing in those sentences that shouldn't be alarming to anyone who genuinely holds left-libertarian views but not only does this not seem to alarm those who claim to be left-libertarians here, you seem toc elebrate it.  

Any libertarian, left or right, should be alarmed by this.  Right-libertarians can legitimately argue that it should be within the rights of these corporations to implement these passports even if they don't like that it's being done but the left-libertarian ideology doesn't even support the first part of that.  They should be the most outraged of all of us and I believe true left-libertarians are and their voices are being drowned out by those who are role playing for the sake of watering down the libertarian ideology.  

I strongly suggest listening to the 'Gary Chartier Week' episodes of Tom Woods podcast.  Gary is a well respected scholar and supporter of left libertarianism and when you listen to what the ideology is truly about you'll see what I mean about how celebrating corporate led authoritarianism is the antithesis of libertarianism, left or right.   I think the argument of whether 'left or right libertarianism is real libertarianism' is misguided and has been largely based on what we've been seeing people with 'left libertarian' flair argue in this sub when the real argument should be how holding authoritarian views, be it left or right, isn't libertarianism.",0,0.059,0.8,0.141,0.9913

The latest thing I heard that bothered me is hearing the hosts from both podcasts crying about Biden's infrastructure plan, and how much money the Biden Administration wants to put into upgrading the US' railroads.

Everybody was complaining that since we couldn't possibly upgrade our rail systems to be as good as Europe--and there was uncertainty about how good the rail system was in Europe, despite none of the hosts having ever traveled by rail through Europe--that we shouldn't even bother trying.

To paraphrase, ""Travel by car, truck, and plane are all we need.""

You know what everyone neglected to mention? [That China has built out \~40,000 km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_China) in the past 15 years!

However, the first issue, that of abortion, is my number one most important issue, and due to the official Libertarian Party's stance I struggle to call myself a libertarian, and even vote libertarian. I voted for Trump for this very reason, along with the fact that I lean far more conservative than I do liberal, so Trump to me was easily better than Hillary and Biden, but that's off topic.

If you're calling a Democrat, state you zip-code and that you support legalized weed, mushrooms, etc. or whatever you're behind. It's also worth pointing out that this policy if very popular and may help them get reelected, and will also potentially lower deficits via spending on enforcement.

The Republican party has nothing to offer. They never put forward a true agenda because they have none beyond serving the interests of the ric


But Trump and Trumpism are just the obvious half the GOP’s existential problem as a party. The other half concerns policy, and connects to that bizarre lack of a 2020 platform. Republicans have no new ideas is the standard summary, but that doesn’t get at the more fundamental and insoluble conundrum that preceded Trump. **The Republican evil geniuses offer no new ideas because they’ve long since SUCCEEDED at achieving their three big structural goals — minimizing taxes on the rich and business, minimizing the regulation of business, and minimizing the power of workers.**

On all of those, they’ve gone about as far as they can go. Only 6% of employees of private companies now belong to unions. The top tax rates on business and rich individuals are much lower than they were for most of the 20th century. When the Republicans try pushing further in big structural ways, like privatizing Social Security or repealing the Affordable Care Act, they fail 

and in fact, if they’d succeeded at either of those I think it would’ve been politically disastrous for them

Are voters about to reward the congressional GOP for unanimously trying to cancel the $1,400 checks that 127 million of them just got? Or angrily rise up to oppose rebuilding bridges and extending broadband and expanding eldercare by means of modestly higher taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest 1% ?

I think not. In fact, given what the Biden Administration and Congress are doing, Democratic candidates in 2022 and 2024 will, for the first time in decades, be able to convincingly say, for instance, that “the Establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election,” and the other party is desperate to maintain a “power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations.” Too angry, too…socialist?

That’s funny, because those are lines from Donald Trump himself, the voice-over in his big closing ad of the 2016 campaign. So the GOP’s one electorally successful “new idea” of the 21st century is a bitter critique of American capitalism as a rigged and viciously unfair? And even when it comes to fighting the latest culture-war battle, their demonized chief adversaries are Fortune 100 corporations like Coca-Cola and Delta? Good luck with that, Republicans.


As the party of the wealthy and big business, how in the world can it convince the working class to vote for its candidates?

This is no small matter. It is not some little glitch. Rather, it is a fundamental core issue that lies at the heart of the Republican Party. It requires a grand strategy at the highest level.

The problem is simple. The GOP exists to serve the interests of the wealthy and big business that comprise the richest 1%. No party, however, can ever win an election with only 1% of the vote. So to win elections, the GOP must necessarily reach beyond its own wealthy core and attempt to convince a large segment of working people in the 99% to vote for Republicans.

But this seems impossible.

The masters at the top require the GOP to maintain policies that favor the richest 1% and disfavor the working class. So Republican policies will necessarily be profoundly unpopular to the 99%. Therefore, the GOP could never receive much more than 1% of the vote and thus could never win elections.

This is quite a conundrum.

Normally, a political party wins elections by offering policies that benefit the voters. These policies attract the voters who then cast their votes for the political party.

But for the Republican Party, this is not an option. A candidate could not possibly campaign on the policies favored by the 1%. Just imagine the stump speech. “Vote for me and I will slash your health care! In fact, I’ll do even better — I'll fight like mad to completely eliminate your health care!”

Vote for me and I will get rid of your pensions! This would save corporations a bundle and boost profits to the shareholders! Screw the workers!”

“Vote for me and I promise to ship your jobs overseas under globalization! The exact same labor can be hired in Asia for only pennies! Hurray!”

This, of course, is not going to work.

The Republican Party is left with only one option. It cannot possibly be honest about its true intentions and actual policies. The working class would never vote for them. Instead, the only option is to lie.

The Republican Party must lie. It has no choice. It must conceal its true inner core. This is a matter of life or death for the party. The survival of the Republican Party itself depends upon lying. It cannot exist without creating a false impression about its true purpose.",0,0.127,0.678,0.195,0.9975

1499,"Why the Republican Party Is Doomed. Unlike the “cultural populism” that costs them nothing, the GOP’s rich rulers can’t abide real share-the-wealth populism 



The Republican party has nothing to offer. They never put forward a true agenda because they have none beyond serving the interests of the ric


But Trump and Trumpism are just the obvious half the GOP’s existential problem as a party. The other half concerns policy, and connects to that bizarre lack of a 2020 platform. Republicans have no new ideas is the standard summary, but that doesn’t get at the more fundamental and insoluble conundrum that preceded Trump. **The Republican evil geniuses offer no new ideas because they’ve long since SUCCEEDED at achieving their three big structural goals — minimizing taxes on the rich and business, minimizing the regulation of business, and minimizing the power of workers.**

On all of those, they’ve gone about as far as they can go. Only 6% of employees of private companies now belong to unions. The top tax rates on business and rich individuals are much lower than they were for most of the 20th century. When the Republicans try pushing further in big structural ways, like privatizing Social Security or repealing the Affordable Care Act, they fail 

and in fact, if they’d succeeded at either of those I think it would’ve been politically disastrous for them

Are voters about to reward the congressional GOP for unanimously trying to cancel the $1,400 checks that 127 million of them just got? Or angrily rise up to oppose rebuilding bridges and extending broadband and expanding eldercare by means of modestly higher taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest 1% ?

I think not. In fact, given what the Biden Administration and Congress are doing, Democratic candidates in 2022 and 2024 will, for the first time in decades, be able to convincingly say, for instance, that “the Establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election,” and the other party is desperate to maintain a “power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations.” Too angry, too…socialist?

That’s funny, because those are lines from Donald Trump himself, the voice-over in his big closing ad of the 2016 campaign. So the GOP’s one electorally successful “new idea” of the 21st century is a bitter critique of American capitalism as a rigged and viciously unfair? And even when it comes to fighting the latest culture-war battle, their demonized chief adversaries are Fortune 100 corporations like Coca-Cola and Delta? Good luck with that, Republicans.


As the party of the wealthy and big business, how in the world can it convince the working class to vote for its candidates?

This is no small matter. It is not some little glitch. Rather, it is a fundamental core issue that lies at the heart of the Republican Party. It requires a grand strategy at the highest level.

The problem is simple. The GOP exists to serve the interests of the wealthy and big business that comprise the richest 1%. No party, however, can ever win an election with only 1% of the vote. So to win elections, the GOP must necessarily reach beyond its own wealthy core and attempt to convince a large segment of working people in the 99% to vote for Republicans.

But this seems impossible.

The masters at the top require the GOP to maintain policies that favor the richest 1% and disfavor the working class. So Republican policies will necessarily be profoundly unpopular to the 99%. Therefore, the GOP could never receive much more than 1% of the vote and thus could never win elections.

This is quite a conundrum.

Normally, a political party wins elections by offering policies that benefit the voters. These policies attract the voters who then cast their votes for the political party.

But for the Republican Party, this is not an option. A candidate could not possibly campaign on the policies favored by the 1%. Just imagine the stump speech. “Vote for me and I will slash your health care! In fact, I’ll do even better — I'll fight like mad to completely eliminate your health care!”

Vote for me and I will get rid of your pensions! This would save corporations a bundle and boost profits to the shareholders! Screw the workers!”

“Vote for me and I promise to ship your jobs overseas under globalization! The exact same labor can be hired in Asia for only pennies! Hurray!”

This, of course, is not going to work.

The Republican Party is left with only one option. It cannot possibly be honest about its true intentions and actual policies. The working class would never vote for them. Instead, the only option is to lie.

The Republican Party must lie. It has no choice. It must conceal its true inner core. This is a matter of life or death for the party. The survival of the Republican Party itself depends upon lying. It cannot exist without creating a false impression about its true purpose.",0,0.127,0.678,0.195,0.9975

I have been operating a food truck for half a year. It went perfectly fine while trump was president (except an encounter with a self proclaimed witch) but as soon as sleepy joe hit the white house it all went south. In february a violent antifa blm thug tried to harass me because of my ""Blue lives matter"" flag i was proudly flying. I tried to defend myself like the roof koreans during the LA riots with my handguns, but then the police arrived and gave me a fine. Then in march i had a big feud with the farmers that were supplying me because their prices were too high due to president biden's tax increases. I managed to keep my connections to some but now i have to source my meat from somewhere else, not good. Then just a few weeks ago i had an incident i already posted about: a government man was telling me that i was not vegan friendly and that i did not comply with state enforced veganism. Then, just a few days ago i calmly explained to a pregnant woman why i cannot serve her. She was so pissed that she called the cops on me, and after a back-and-forth their SEIZED my food truck claiming i was ""unfit to run a business"" and ""actively delusional"" total BS! In less than 100 days i went from proud small business owner to unemployed and alone (my girlfriend left me) all because of joe biden.

Science doesn’t matter, statistics don’t matter, facts don’t matter. They don’t have a platform outside of trying to win power by restricting voting access and using false narratives or outright lies (the most recent is Biden banning meat, which there is no truth to but a lot on the right has accepted it as fact) to trick there base into outrage.

A large potion of this country has been brainwashed into voting against their interests and supporting authoritarian policies in the name of fear and misinformation. 

I’m not saying the left is perfect in anyway and I have some serious issues with some of their policy goals. Yet, as of right now they are the only functioning political party (that holds real power) in America. This is bad for a lot of reasons, mainly, that for our government to work properly we need at least two (I would argue more like 3-5) functioning political parties.

What we need now more then ever are for the people on the right who aren’t tricked by the propaganda and outright lies to stand up with one voice and fight for the soul of their party before it slides completely into neofascism.

We get a lot of authoritarian righties in here from other subs that love to spread outright lies to backup their authoritarian narrative. Thankfully, we also have a large amount of conservatives in the sub that fight the false narratives.

A major theme of Biden's speech was the Green New Deal, heavy taxation and ""the government creates prosperity.""  The government just can't create prosperity.  The government can tax and print money- but it can't create prosperity like the free market can.  

The ""Green New Deal"" and infrastructure bills are designed to get as many people working for the government instead of the private sector as possible.  There were a lot of blue collar workers working in government factories in the Soviet Union, they just didn't create prosperity. 

It's pretty obvious that the Biden administration takes a lot of inspiration from Marxism.  The Biden administration is big into unionization, he said ""unions created the middle class,"" but said nothing about the factories and businesses who pay those unions.  It seems like he he wants every city to be run like Detroit.

Psaki: ""The president has said and I have said from here many times that there needs to be a credible, independent investigation, through the World Health Organization and one that relies on data; relies on participation from China"" 5/7/21 Newsmax reporter [Emerald Robinson asked White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki some questions](https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1390725903714508800?s=20) about President Joe Biden's position on a potential lab-leak origin for the pandemic:

&amp;#x200B;

Emerald Robinson: ""....The NIH and Dr Fauci, had provided funding to the Wuhan Lab of Virology - that's the lab in question - when we talk about the lab-leak theory, and, given that gain-of-function research is dicey, why would the US fund that in China? Why would Dr Fauci?""

&amp;#x200B;

Jen Psaki: ""I'm happy to send you to the NIH about more specifics of what program they funded and more details of that""

&amp;#x200B;

Emerald Robinson: ""you know I do have one more follow up""

&amp;#x200B;

Jen Psaki: ""okay?""

Emerald Robinson: ""what the president hasn't really weighed in - Dr Fauci is one of the voices who discredit the lab leak theory but now there's more officials, in the Biden administration, like the director of National Intelligence, the CIA director, and now also the NIH director who say that this cannot be ruled out and there's calls for more investigation into it. Who does the president agree with, Dr. Fauci or the other officials - does he this think this - it was a lab leak?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Jen Psaki:

""Well, the president has said and I have said from here many times, that, there needs to be a credible, independent investigation, uh, through the World Health Organization- and one that relies on data, relies on participation from China, and other uh countries that may have information, that's certainly something everybody has called for and we look forward to that happening.""

&amp;#x200B;

Emerald Robinson:

""Why hasn't the president spoken with President Xi about the origins of the Coronavirus yet he said uh just a few weeks ago he hadn't yet.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jen Psaki:

""Uh I think we have given a readout of his call and also that The President believes there should be an independent investigation led by health experts, um and one where the data is provided that's provided transparently to our medical uh and science experts here in the United States and we look forward to reviewing that.

&gt;[Intro]
Yeah
I don't wanna do it
But I feel like I got to

&gt;[Verse 1]
Good morning America, time to get to waking up
We've never all at once been confronted with so much crazy stuff
We should be able to find the truth, but they make it tough
You'd think the news would tell you, but most of that they've been making up
For anyone who's good, there's a John Wilkes Booth
All the Jedis lying dead, while the Sith grow roots
And if you try to speak the truth, they'll Anthony Bourdain you
Hang you and use suicide to explain you
We don't all need to agree, but how can you not see-
There's an elite and they fucking everyone like you and me?
That ain't race, color or creed, it's predatory greed
And if we don't unite, this might not be the land of the free-
For much longer, rights getting stripped real fast
While we fight each other, 'cause they want us just like that
We so divided by race, religion, color and class
Now it's who does and doesn't motherfucking wear a mask?
And the virus is real but it's seeming like they planned it
The way they're using it to their political advantage
I don't claim to have the answers but I'm telling you what
Bill Gates is mad sus, sketchy as fuck
2020 been some shit, fuckin' life got crazy
Bunch of trolls looking for someone to type at, angry
Y'all just hate on everybody, it's just like that lately
I got an auntie named Karen, she's a nice-ass lady
And I thought I was a liberal for most of my life
But holy Christ, you fucking lefties have been colder than ice
And I can't believe I'm saying it, honestly I hate this shit
But I got more in common with Trump supporters and Reagan-ists
Than fake woke bums cancelling everyone
We say one thing y'all don't like and our fucking career's done
No more open dialogue or conversation at all
No debate or discussion, what can I say? I'm appalled
'Cause if we're not allowed to talk or fucking have an opinion
Without you sensitive bitches enforcing public crucifixions
Then we're all fucked, so this is me speaking my peace
Shit, I would go down shooting for my freedom of speech
And that's the first two amendments loaded in one clip
Aiming at this broke political system we're stuck with
They got all our phones tapped so let 'em listen to this
Y'all recording? Suck my motherfucking dick, bitch

&gt;[Chorus]
Here we go again, here we go again
Raw thoughts
Here we go again, here we go again
Raw thoughts
Here we go again, here we go again
These motherfucking raw thoughts
Here we go again, here we go again
Line 'em up

&gt;[Verse 2]
This motherfucker, Joe Biden
You dementia-ridden, geriatric, evil puppet, piece of dog-shit, old lying son of a bitch
Do y'all really think he's the answer?
They got to pump him full of drugs so he can speak on the camera
And this dumb, boomer Chuck Schumer' calling the shots
Saw him pull up just the other day and park in the lot
Went to say ""Hi"" and realized that this guy is such a fucking pussy
That he wore a fucking N95 while he drives
And Pelosi, that evil Golden Girl with her cronies
Ilhan Omar and A.O.C., all of you can blow me
And Kamala Harris too, I'll run a train on the whole fucking crew
No Scott Wiener, not including you
Weird shit going on, I mean Epstein, Ghislaine
Missing kids, adrenochrome, I don't know, I'm just saying
I just keep my shit a hundred percent, so if you doubt me
You must be getting your statistics from Anthony Fauci
And Bernie sold out, he supported Joe and Hillary-
After they stole the primary from him, you must be kidding me?
Bernie, I used to fuck with you, where's your fucking integrity?
Can't go from standing for something to standing with the enemy
Oh fuck you, Chris
Now that's enough of the blue
Let's get to aiming at the red, someone bring in Ted Cruz
You're just so damn punch-able, borderline fully unlovable
Even your daughter avoids hugging you
Who else? Mike Pence, who's obsessed with his wife
So I consensually had sex with her twice the other night
Told me she ain't had the dick in weeks
So I fucked her on your pile of Bibles, Mike
She really is a religious freak
That is just completely inappropriate
Mitch McConnell, you are the literal definition of not having a face for television
Please, wear a mask, keep that fucking shit hidden
You look like a guy who shouldn't be in the presence of children
Wait, did someone say children?
Easy does it, Bill, you and Hillary chill
Justice is coming for you still
Because one day, the world will see the truth, that's a bet
I just hope I'm here to see it and you ain't murdered me yet
And see, then there's Donald Trump, this motherfucker been on one
A chance to say the right thing, he goes and says the wrong one
When there's a chance to unite us, he instead
Divides us even more with the stupid shit that he says
And I can't stand for it
His environmental policy makes George-fucking-W look like he's Captain Planet
Rolling regulations back, setting back clean air and water
All to put big business on a better track
While the animals suffer, so do we
The rich save a little money while they poison you and me
So geez, is he the lesser or greater of two evils?
Or is he really tryna drain the swamp and help the people?
Ask me, I don't even fucking know anymore
I feel like every politician's just a pawn on the board
Trump and Biden alike, so until I stand corrected
I'll be saying ""Fuck every politician that's been elected""
And the truth hurts, but fuck it man, ignorance is worse
Even Google's in on it, I can't trust my own search
They treat us like the sheep, they the wolves in the dark
Playing with our lives, and our minds and our hearts
We been living in the Matrix, losing our direction
Evil algorithms altering all our perceptions
So what the fuck do I know? And what the fuck do you?
Shit, we all just confused tryna find what's true
So I never say I'm right about everything that I said
Not telling you to agree, don't really want people dead
But fuck, this shit been so messed up for so long
And my only way to process it is put it in a song
'Cause all I got's some paper with a pen and mic
And my fucking first amendment right, tell 'em again like
All I got's some paper with a pen and mic
And my fucking first amendment right, raw thoughts

&gt;[Outro]
You have two new messages
Hey Chris, it's Joe Biden
Listen man, I uh, I wanted to uh, wait?
Who did I call again? Is anyone there?
Hello? Jill, ah damn it Jill
How do I use this stupid phone?
Next message
Hey Chris, Trump here
Donald Trump, the president
Anyways, I heard your song, terrible stuff, really terrible
I think it's tremendously important that I remind you that I, Donald Trump
Am probably, most likely, but definitely probably
The best President we've ever had in this country
And you're just a loser rapper recording songs in his basement, okay?
Now I will admit, the line about having sex with Pence's wife was actually pretty funny though
Uh sir, what the fuck?
Oh sorry, Mike, I forgot you were standing right next to me
Anyways, God bless America

The bloated Federal and State governments have no right to override small local government laws (unless of course it's to outlaw minimum wage increases, rent control which distorts the housing market in a bad way, or property tax increases). Local government is always just and when you think about it, isn't really government at all, at least when it comes to policies I support.

1696,"Hank Hill is a Libertarian I was thinking about the upcoming King of the Hill reboot at work today and got to thinking about how various characters wouldn't changed considering the craziness of the last few years. You could go all kinds of fun and whacky directions theorizing about any of them, from Bobby going to college and becoming over-the-top woke to Dale going off the deep end reading about QAnon online. 

A lot of those possible options would be up to the writers of course, but the more I thought about it the more I was sure of one thing. Hank Hill would definitely have voted Libertarian in the 2020 election and probably in the 2016 election too.

Hear me out, Hank was definitely an old school Reagan Republican in the existing episodes. That was a different political landscape, when you could shrug of Bush Jr. and Romney being mediocre establishment centrists and still feel alright about your vote as a Republican. 

Trump on the other hand, from his egotistical bullying to his sleazy dishonesty, would no doubt disgust Hank so much that he could never vote Trump. I suspect by 2020 Hank would feel too outraged to even vote Republican as he saw candidates at every level of the party capitulate and abandon their principles.

I also don't see Hank voting Hillary. He hated Bill Clinton and would probably see her as a hollow bullshitter.  It's even more unimaginable he would vote for Biden considering his anti-gun stances, flip-flopping, allegations of sexual harassment and overall left-leaning big government rhetoric.

And any King of the Hill fan knows Hank isn't a lesser of two evils kind of guy, so would he just not vote? No, because he also isn't a quitter. You still might question whether Hank could vote for a party that advocates drug legalization, criminal justice reform and LGBTQ rights. Well, maybe not where the show left off, but without a doubt in 2021. 

A major theme of King of the Hill is Hank becoming more open minded and accepting while holding onto his core values of accountability and integrity. Sure, he's still kind of a social conservative with a stick up his ass. But it stands to reason he would keep believing in self reliance and hard work while also realizing that people should be free to live life as they please even if he doesn't always understand their way of life. 

On top of that Hank Hill, and King of the Hill in general, has always made no secret of the absurdity of beaurocracy and over-regulation. Hank can be kind of a control freak, but a lot of episodes center on him letting that go and trusting people in his life to make their own decisions. If you think about Hank growing as a person and developing as a character it would make complete sense that he would see the Libertarian party as more reasonable and trustworthy than the Republicans or Democrats of 2021.

Anyway, if you made it this far in my rant, the point is Hank Hill is a Libertarian and anyone who says otherwise is a dang idiot. If you don't watch King of the Hill, I'm impressed you made it this far and would highly recommend you check it out.",0,0.114,0.739,0.147,0.9389

Everytime I told people I voted for Jo they assumed Biden until I said it was a women then they had no idea who I was talking about. 

2. We need to push harder to get on the debate floors, my opinions aside this may require a candidate with a household “trump like” name. Preferably someone who’s got a successful business background 

3. I hate to say this, but vermin actually hurts the party, in my opinion. No one is going to take a third-party serious when it’s most popular candidate wears a rubber boot for a hat. Even though I think he is awesome in every way, I don’t think he should be representing the party for a presidential role

4. We need more college campus outreach, that is where the Democrats are winning. They know these young kids in college are all looking for someone not named Trump, so the only other thing these kids usually know of or are exposed too is a Democrat whether it’s Bernie or Joe

5. I say this from the bottom of my heart, I think we need to invest in whatever advertising we can to drive home the fact to all our fellow citizens that there is other options, and this other option would force the government to start to work for us the people again

I’m sure I’m going to get crushed for my opinion of vermin because I know libertarians get defensive of him, and like I said I do love him. But I think he makes the party look like a joke when it comes to presidential races.

1767,"The US government has agreed to fight the American people. Let's consider [the statement by America's top military officer](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GeneralMilleyTestifiesToCongressThatWhiteRageCausedAnAttackOnCapitolToOverturnConstitution.mp4) in context.

After decades of [establishment assaults on the American people from the so-called left](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/why-false-left-right-paradigm-exists-and-establishment-is-left/) ....

After America had just experienced several months of BLM burning buildings, breaking windows, looting stores, carrying guns, shooting people, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails, expressing racism, and attacking white bystanders .... because cops shoot black people at the same rate per encounter as white people .... and which was whitewashed as ""mostly peaceful"" protests by the establishment ....

And after unarmed Trump voters protesting the [stolen election](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/2020-trump-biden-election-fraud-voter-cheating-self-evident/) at the Capitol caused no fires or deaths, shot no one, bullied no bystanders, expressed no racism, broke no windows, planted no bombs, threw no rocks or Molotov cocktails, destroyed no property, and rejected the agents provocateur trying to incite them .... and are being blackwashed by the entire establishment ....

*Then* .... *in that context* .... General Mark Milley, Chariman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifying before Congress, June 23, 2021, [said](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GeneralMilleyTestifiesToCongressThatWhiteRageCausedAnAttackOnCapitolToOverturnConstitution.mp4):

&gt;I want to understand white rage, and *I'm white*.^(--General Mark Milley, Chariman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifying before Congress, June 23, 2021)

Given his statement before that, one might think he merely wanted to know what other people meant by ""white rage"", but his next words made his meaning clear:

&gt;What is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building \[the Capitol\] and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that?

His boss, the Commander in Chief, had [just said](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/biden-says-u-s-experienced-worst-attack-on-democracy-since-civil-war/2590458/) he inherited:

&gt;The worst attack on our Democracy Since the Civil War.^(--Joe Biden, address to Congress, April 28, 2021)

Joe Biden would have been correct if he had meant that the *stolen election* was the worst threat on our Democracy since the Civil War, but he was referring to the *peaceful protest* of the stolen election. He would also have been correct if he had meant that the actions of the US government during the Civil War (e.g. imprisoning legislators to stop them from voting) were a threat to democracy, because it is a logical error to call secession a threat to democracy, but he meant that *secession* was the threat to democracy.

Then Joe Biden [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/jun/01/joe-biden-tulsa-oklahoma-race-massacre-us-politics-live) just days before Milley's statement to Congress: that white supremacy is the ""most lethal threat"" to America.

The words of General Milley were the next step in the end game of the Apex Players. The US military is the final part of the establishment that has declared the American people to be the enemy. Even the US military itself probably didn't know why it was ordered to engage in asymmetric warfare--*hard*\--for 50 years, but many of us have known since the Clinton administration.

However, the US military has its own intelligence branch, so it knows the election was stolen, and it knows who is being whitewashed and who is being blackwashed. It knows that ""white rage"" is bullshit. It knows that all almost all terrorism is perpetrated directly or indirectly by the US establishment or its global masters. It knows that secession is a right (that's how America was formed) and that secession is not a threat to democracy. It knows that the American establishment has done everything it can to strengthen China (limited only by having to maintain [the illusion of legitimacy](https://endofinnocence.com/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad/)). It knows that [the American government doesn't work for the American people](https://endofinnocence.com/opium-afghanistan-war-asymmetric-nwo-cabal-illusion-legitimacy/), and at this late stage, it has to be fully aware that it is being set up to fight the American people .... and it has agreed ....

As bad as that sounds, the reality is worse. [The American establishment admits that it uses false flags and secret provocations to start any war that it wants to happen.](https://endofinnocence.com/winep-admits-us-false-flag-iran/)",0,0.202,0.758,0.04,-0.9991

""The President's Budget"" or ""The President's Plan.""  Where? Why? How?

&amp;#x200B;

Article II gives the executive creed: 

The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows

Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.

The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.

No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.

In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.

The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.

Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:– I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.

### Section 2

The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.

He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.

The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.

### Section 3

He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.

### Section 4

1782,"Having a stickied post where Biden speaks about canons is ridiculous when voting rights are being debated Basically the title. People waited in long lines last election and many had their votes thrown away, cast out, or made too difficult to be feasible. We also saw direct [efforts to undermine the USPS](https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-will-not-replace-removed-mail-sorting-machines-2020-8) (wasting heaps of taxpayer money) to prevent mail-in voting, though the [president had done that himself](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/19/903886567/trump-while-attacking-mail-voting-casts-mail-ballot-again) on many occasions and praised it. Finally, we had riots in our capital where the halls of our government were infiltrated, police were attacked, and leaders on all sides of the political aisles were threatened, again - to overturn the election.

Now, the Supreme Court has [upheld restrictive voting laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/us/supreme-court-arizona-voting-restrictions.html), voting along partisan lines while admitting in that it would disproportionately affect the poor and minorities. 


Justice Alito also directly commented about the fraud allegations, insisting this:

&gt;“Fraud can affect the outcome of a close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of citizens to cast ballots that carry appropriate weight,” he wrote. “Fraud can also undermine public confidence in the fairness of elections and the perceived legitimacy of the announced outcome.”

The law prevents third party groups from collecting ballots (probably a good thing), and allows ballots cast in the wrong district to be invalidated. Now that may sound reasonable, but if you have moved or gone to college, this could easily target your ballot. We've also seen the partisan efforts to overturn the election in Arizona, which makes this even more concerning. Alito said in his decision:

&gt;""It appears that the core of [Section 2] is the requirement that voting be 'equally open.' The statute's reference to equal 'opportunity' may stretch that concept to some degree to include consideration of a person's ability to use the means that are equally open. But equal openness remains the touchstone,"" Alito wrote.

&gt;""Mere inconvenience cannot be enough to demonstrate a violation of [Section 2],"" he added.

To reiterate, we had massive lines last election - during a pandemic. We had direct interference with mail-in voting. We had efforts, with little to no evidence, to invalidate massive amounts of votes for the winning candidate as ""fraudulent."" While Alito isn't ruling on these events, to look at the big picture and describe all of this as ""mere inconvenience,"" during a worldwide emergency, is disturbing. The opinion then goes on to ramble about schemes to buy votes and how hard it was for Arizona to detect fraud:

&gt;The Commission warned that vote buying schemes are far more difficult to detect when citizens vote by mail,” and it  recommended  that  “States  therefore  should  reduce  the  risks of fraud and abuse in absentee voting by prohibiting ‘third-party’  organizations,  candidates,  and  political  party  activists from handling absentee ballots.” 

This all feels rather partisan to me, and given the events of the past year should be a real cause for concern. Certainly, it's fine to debate the 2nd amendment, but I'm disturbed how we seem to miss the forest for the trees here.",0,0.135,0.795,0.07,-0.9888
1783,"Hey fellow Tennessean libertarians! Tired of censorship and one sided group-think on subs named after your favorite cities? I made a sub for 2 of my favorite Tennessee cities that focus on Freedom of Speech without censorship, civilized debating, and discussion about local issues. I created r/Nashvillereal and r/RealChattanooga to represent the majority of people in this state since many of these subs seem to be shilling for political agendas. Too many times I have seen others banned from a sub simply for pointing out government corruption, ongoing conspiracies, bad policies, opinions on government shutdowns, etc. 

Now I won’t specifically point the finger but a majority of this happens on subs like r/Nashville where it seems like liberal and leftist agendas are the only things not being censored. The second you say something about Fauci, Biden, or any of the corruption on that side you usually immediately get banned. I don’t know if it’s because certain people just can’t handle the truth or these subs are just controlled by very left leaning mods. I do not believe these subs accurately represent the majority of folks in this state or even these areas. 

The subs I created are not in support of either political side and we will accept arguments from either side. The main point of this sub is to support freedom of speech and give people an outlet where they can speak their mind without being censored. We WILL NOT tolerate racism of any kind or bullying. 

Our constitutional rights exist for a reason and without an outlet for people from all sides of the isle to have political discourse without being banned things can/are getting more extreme. 

Anyone who feels like their opinion is the end all be all and everything else should be censored normally deep down inside know they are probably incorrect. Which is why i believe so many popular mods are ban happy, specifically the liberal ones. 

I created these subs because I for one am tired of nearly every major social media company censoring whatever they are paid to censor. I am tired of my peers turning to false propaganda solely due to everything else being censored. 

These subs are for you and myself to escape the massive reddit hive-mind/group-think to discuss REAL local issues fairly, openly, and without censorship. They are for all the people out there fed up with being censored by some 500 pound mod who lives in his mothers basement and doesn’t even live in the city he mods. They are for people who believe in the freedom of speech and supporters of Liberty. 

Its time we have our own communities where everyone can contribute opinions regardless of political leanings. 

Feel free to contribute and improve these subs as you please. Thanks.

*\*Disclaimer\**

So I am going to call myself a socialist in this thread (my socialism differs from the socialism of Marx or that which you have heard of, to give you an idea I want to be an entrepreneur as my dream job and this entirely fits with my ideology). I have posted on here before and used the word socialist and people immediately shut down, call me a marxist (i'm a socialist, not a marxist, there's a difference), say I love the USSR (I don't), or just want to destroy freedom. If you're planning on leaving that comment, can I ask that instead you just leave this post alone? I'm trying to have a genuine discussion here and I want to engage with people I disagree with in a respectful manner. I would greatly appreciate actual discussion. Thanks!

*\*End of Disclaimer\**

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so this is gonna be a wall of text. Imma try and break it into sections to make it easier to read. If you want to skip straight to my appeal to y'all, it's at the end, but for it to make sense I would recommend reading the rest, but hey if you're short on time have at it.

*\*What do I believe\**

I am a liberal socialist. To many that may sound like a contradiction (trust me, socialists have come after me for saying that), but it is a real ideology: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal\_socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_socialism)

Anyways, here's a basic summary of what I believe: I think that a market economy is the best route to take. The difference between me and a capitalist is that i would say that workers and sometimes consumers should own parts of the firms that sell to them for the most part. Now, on a smaller scale, fully private industry, fully consumer or worker coops should exist, but the majority of the economy should consist of small to medium sized firms that are often partially owned by consumers, workers, and the founder. A startup would likely start as an entirely private enterprise, cause it is just easier to run those as a startup and there are more resources, but as the firm grows it should transition. I can talk about how to bring about this transition if you want (you can do this for competitive pressure (a very libertarian way of doing it) after a certain critical mass is reached) but that's a lot of detail that's not relevant to this post. I'd be glad to talk about it if you want. Anyways, I see socialism as a natural conclusion of liberal thought and that private property of capital should be allowed, though again most firms should have split ownership. I am also a georgist/geo-libertarian so I am opposed to private landownership and instead would propose a land value tax that effectively serves as a way to ""lease"" land to people. Again, that's sorta irrelevant for this post, but I'm glad to talk about it if you want.

\**Where do we agree\**

So believe it or not, you all agree with a socialist far more than you think you do. Let me explain. I think the regulatory state is problematic. Why? Because of regulatory capture. Big business buy and sell politicians all the time, both political parties these days are bought and sold by big industries (I mean hell the ""socialist marxist neoliberal biden"" of conservative fear is having his climate agenda suppressed by big oil, our drug prices are kept high thanks to bought and sold politicians and rent-seeking corporations, etc). Regulatory capture is absolutely a real thing and most definitely takes place and insulates big business from competition, allowing for monopolies/oligopolies that lead to massive market failures and hurt americans. Now, unlike y'all I think a certain degree of regulation is required, primarily anti-trust legislation. I'll talk about this more in the next section, but I'm not 100% against regulation, I just think we should be very very cautious about it and many of the regulations in place (cough cough occupational licensing, single family zoning, etc) only serve to keep out competitors. 

We also agree on the tendency of larger overbearing states to become authoritarian.

We agree on democracy

We agree on free trade and free markets (I am a free market anti-capitalist).

We agree on some degree of private property (where my Geo-libertarains &amp; Left-libertarians at?)

We agree on the idea that large institutions tend to be corrupted

We agree competition is a good thing

&amp;#x200B;

*\*Where do we disagree\**

So we do disagree on several things. Notably private landownership, the economy existing of entirely private firms, anti-trust enforcement/regulation (basically, my view is that over time, markets tend to consolidate because it is more efficient and cheaper to do that. As such, markets will naturally become more centralized. This reduces competitive pressure and brings out the worst effects of capitalism/markets. Anti-trust legislation is needed to prevent this, this is probably our biggest source of contention).

I also believe in a strong welfare state, but universalized, not relying on testing and whatnot. So everyone has a right to choose a public option for healthcare, rich or poor. Same goes for other basic necessities like food. 

&amp;#x200B;

*\*My plea to y'all\**

I'm going to be honest, these days I don't have a very positive opinion of a lot of republicans. I see how trump has taken over the party and how many republicans basically worship the guy. He was anti-free trade anti-free markets authoritarian hypocritical anti-democratic and just an all around cruel and selfish asshole. yet so many republicans worshiped him despite terrible terrible policies and character traits.

However, to me the republican party has one redeeming feature and that would the genuine libertarians in it who were worried about trump. I remember seeing trump criticism on this sub and I remember arguments about it. Some of y'all didn't immediately fall into that cult, and for that good job. We disagree on plenty, but I think I could actually work with you. However, there are a lot of people who call themselves libertarian and really aren't. They are conservatives who don't want to call themselves conservatives. These are the types who constantly jump to the defense of the police after every frickin shooting. What kind of libertarian is pro-cop and pro-state? Doesn't that defeat the whole point? I have no doubt some of them will comment here cause they didn't read my disclaimer or didn't care about it.

So here's my plea to y'all. What can be done to convince you guys to work with leftists like myself in this country? I want genuine work to unify the country and work to improve our lives. I'm trying to reach out to people I see as reasonable on the right and I'm willing to compromise to present a united front, a pan-american front against the authoritarian q-nut neofascist cult that's taken over much of the republican party. I really do want a better future for the country and I think you guys can be part of that. So this is my reaching out to you from the left. What would we need to work out to present a united front? Do y'all think you can work with me and other leftie people? 

Thanks for the feedback.

Also, imma copy the disclaimer again for anyone who skipped right to this section:

As my life has progressed I've read more and more political theory, engaged in more and more debates with people of differing views, and that drew me to the left as I personally identify with those ideas more than conservative ones having grew up in a particularly impoverished part of the South. I'm pretty familiar with a lot of the arguments on both sides, and I'm also aware that most people on both sides don't actually have much knowledge of their own political views, and DEFINITELY don't have much knowledge of the people on the other side of the fence. I'm here to engage in a good faith debate/discussion with you guys.

I have an extreme distaste for the level of polarization in American politics, hence why I'm here to get you guys side of the story, and to hopefully tell you mine. 

On that note, I'd like to provide a bit of an explanation to what my view of socialism is, and specifically explain the three big words you hear thrown around: Socialism, Marxism, and Communism. 

So socialism is a bit of an umbrella term, but I tend to view it as having two definitions. One is what I call a spiritual definition, or just simply what it boils down to in essence, and the other is a functional definition, or how it usually manifests itself/the practical real world application of the spiritual definition. So the spiritual definition of socialism, at least in my view, is that it is a criticism of capitalism. Socialists look at capitalism and believe it to be a better system than feudalism or slavery, but that it in and of itself is flawed and that humanity can do better, and so socialists seek to do better. The functional definition of socialism is the communal ownership or regulation of the means of production either through the state, the formation of worker co-ops, or the formation of labor unions. Typically socialists view a lot of the problems of capitalism as stemming directly from a power imbalance within the enterprise that tips more towards the business owner, and the proposed solution is to give the workers more power in the enterprise, if not give them all the power. 

If socialism is a criticism of capitalism, then Marxism is the most developed of these criticisms. Marxism is simply an ideology that buys into the ideas espoused by Karl Marx. Karl Marx was a 19th Century German philosopher who's work highly criticized the capitalist system and sought to provide some insight into how it worked, what it's problems were, and provide some theoretical solutions to those problems. I don't consider myself a Marxist, as albeit I view his critique of capitalism to be very thorough and comprehensive, I don't necessarily agree with all of his solutions. 

Communism is a state of society, and also a sort of ideology. Communism, simply put, is a stateless, classless, and moneyless society in which the people own the means of production. To say that either Thee Soviet Union or The People's Republic of China are communist countries would be incorrect. They both have states, they both had money, and they both had classes. They violated three of the four things that makes a communist society communist and therefore aren't communist. China actually breaks all four. The Soviet Union was an Authoritarian State Socialist Society that was run by the Communist Party. China is an Authoritarian State Capitalist Society that is run by the Communist Party. The party in power does not determine the state of society. A pretty easy to view it is like this: regardless of whether Biden or Trump is president, and regardless of which party holds the majority of power in the government, America is still a Constitutional Representative Republic. The Democratic Party holding most of the power doesn't make us a democracy. We are a republic either way, so it's best not to confuse party names with states of society, economic models, and systems of government. Communism as an ideology is very simple. If you're a socialist who aims to achieve a communist society as an end goal, you are a communist. If you do not want to achieve that, but are still a socialist, then you are a socialist, but not a communist. You can be a socialist without being a communist, but you can't be a communist without being a socialist.

Even though social media is one of the primary ways we communicate with everyone. 

I also want to say if you agree with letting the government police, censor and ban our speech you are definitely not a libertarian. Youre more of a Neo Liberal. 

The reason I am asking is because we know how that the Biden administration has finally admitted that they work with social media to ban and censor certain individuals. For those of us who are payign attention we already knew the democrats were already working with social media. Its just now the biden administration is admitting that they are working with social media undert the guise of censoring ""misinformation"".

The USA isn't at war with Somalia and no one is asking why we're spending billions of dollars to drop bombs on them in the hope of curtailing local militias that swear allegiance to al-Qaeda, the same al-Qaeda that took down the towers on September 11th, and the same al-Qaeda that the USA implicitly backed by engineering the overthrow of Assad and destabilization of the Syrian state. 

Drone strikes like these almost never make the nightly news, and when they are occasionally given screen time, they're uniformly accompanied by a neoconservative pundit explaining to middle America that we have to disintegrate some goat herders in a barren wasteland because they hate us for our freedom and don't you know those Islamic extremists are a threat to our democracy?

And yet despite a supermajority among their constituents, we do not have a major anti-war party in the United States of America. As libertarians who believe in the free market, property rights, and a principle of non-aggression, war is the antithesis of everything we stand for, and we should be spreading the word about the American Empire's endless wars that serve no one besides the weapons manufacturers getting fat contracts and the politicians signing off on them.",0,0.15,0.764,0.086,-0.9775

You don't see it because every other opinion/questioning of the narrative gets censored into oblivion by lockdown simps and the media. But it's only a matter of time before there become electoral consequences over this. The goal posts keep moving. Everyone sees it. We've reached the point now where if you are vaccinated and don't have symptoms, the CDC still wants you to get tested if you were exposed. 

If you are one of those people that keep gaslighting the public on this and saying it's not happening or you're one of those people trying to somehow do mental gymnastics to try and justify the goalposts moving you're in for a big shock in about a year and a half from now.

The candidate/party that runs in 2022/2024 (most likely republicans) that runs on returning to normal is going to win in a massive landslide whether covid is defeated or not. Full stop. 

The functional adults of our society want to go back to normal. Before, they were okay with mandates and restrictions because covid was a new thing. But now we have a vaccine that is proven to reduce spread, reduce risk of dying, and is effective against most variants so far. The functional adults are done with all this, even if they're not being as vocal as the covid cultists or anti-vaxxers. They're just probably not talking to you because you scream at them for disagreeing with you and they don't bother.

Furthermore, return of restrictions even if you are vaxxed is only going to make un vaxxed people double down and convince them they were right to wait.

The vaccines either work- and people can begin living their lives again; or they don’t work and the unvaxxed were right all along. You can’t just keep trying to convince people they work at stopping the spread and getting you infected and then tell people they still have to wear masks to “protect themselves and others” even if they are vaxxed. It’s a contradiction.

I’m not advocating for one party I personally think it would be much worse than a bipartisan system, and potentially cripple democracy if not make it pointless to vote entirely. Like why would you go to the polls if there was one option? 

 I think there needs to be more than two parties maybe every single party should not only be on the ballots in every state. They should be allowed on the debate stage. It’s easy to say libertarians should be the third party.. but, why not the Green Party, or Whigs. Or even an option for independent candidates to run without an affiliation to a party? Maybe we’d have to restructure things leading up to November but, I don’t think democrats and republicans should be allowed to monopolize the government and politics and I believe the American people should be able to weigh every option not just the two. And who knows maybe having more options would cut through the tribalism and extreme polarization. Or maybe it would add to it. However, how we get their short of a massive sociopolitical movement/protest  I’m not sure. Maybe create an alternate and open sourced internet, or an open sourced cable service to get other voices onto people’s television sets, tablets, phones, radios etc. or on foot campaigns.  (I’m not a tech guy so some of that may be impossible. Just spit balling here.) 

But,  yea not to get too detailed I am curious how libertarians view a one party system. My guess is libertarians would ultimately be against it. Cause I can see how it could become a detriment to society.


Granted I could of coined a scenario where democrats disappear but republicans become the only party. But, I don’t see how that is possible. Republicans don’t have the cultural power or much institutional and their holding onto political power in DC by a thread.  That could be gone by 2022. 2024.

1915,"President Eisenhower's Warning on the Military-Industrial Complex Some of you are likely familiar with President Eisenhower's farewell address in 1961 in which he gave a stark warning about the development of a military-industrial complex. He specifically warned about a ""technological elite"" that would come to control society and smash the illusion of free will. 

He had these fears because it was under his presidency that America, for the first time in its history, had developed a permanent armaments industry during peacetime. While acknowledging the necessity of this arms industry because of technological advancement, he warned in very clear terms against over-funding the military and over-expecting from it to avoid becoming reliant on a system of constant warfare to keep the industry funded. 

Eisenhower left office 60 years ago and since then, America has entered two harrowing and questionable wars that we will remember for a long time along with dozens of less-noticed efforts driven by the military-industrial complex. The Vietnam War faced intense domestic protest and rage, ultimately ending when we decided there was little reason to stay or much else we could do. The Afghanistan War was driven by out of control fear regarding a threat that ultimately did not pose much risk to domestic security following 9/11 and similarly ended when we decided there was little reason to stay or much else we could do.

I wonder where we stand now as Trump started and Biden is finishing pulling the US out of the Middle East militarily. We seem to have somewhat effectively self-corrected after Vietnam and now Afghanistan, but the fact that they happened and continued to happen means that the military-industrial complex is and has been a potent force in American politics for decades. 

Listening to Eisenhower's speech is pretty enlightening, I would say. He's blunt and brutally honest, both with his fears and his failures from his two terms in office. [Here](https://youtu.be/OyBNmecVtdU) is a link to his speech and [here](https://youtu.be/EgbQm2F-EAI) is a link to a kind of video essay I made diving into Eisenhower's words and warnings more if you're interested in getting into this topic in more depth",0,0.116,0.801,0.083,-0.8555

The CDC extended the eviction moratorium for 60 days in counties with ""substantial and high levels"" of community transmission. 

This is after the Supreme Court said that the CDC doesn’t actually have any authority to enforce the moratorium, and that in order for it to continue past July 31, congress would need to pass legislation. 

In the article, Biden blatantly explains that the moratorium is likely unconstitutional, but argues it’s worth extending anyways. Biden said ""at a minimum"" that by the time this works its way through the courts, some of the funds will be able to reach renters who are struggling. He is unashamedly admitting that he and the CDC have no authority to do this, but that they will anyways until the courts tell them they can’t! This is ENRAGING and shows Biden’s blatant disregard for the constitution. 

Renters have NO RIGHT to occupy someone else’s property without compensation and abiding by the terms of the lease agreement they signed. Moratoriums like this are a slippery slope and will lead to a world where property rights don’t exist, because the government will say that everyone has a right to everything.

some people saw through the lies, some people where educated enough to know that the lies contradict reality, and other people saw examples out in the wild that objectively questioned the narrative. these people where silenced and ostracized by government and social media. they where called criminals for spreading ""misinformation.""

ironically tho, just about everything these people who dared to not conform, has turned out to be true.  it has come to pass that almost every i have heard, that got labeled as ""unscientific"" is actually true. and everything that where where told the ""science was settled"" about is actually a lie. 

i remember laughing my ass off when the Fauci FOIA emails got leaked. it basically proved that the covid responses for canada and the US are based off of lies. it proved that what people had been saying for the past year where correct. its showed that sadly millions of peoples lives where permanently altered due to covid hysteria. 

The bottom line, I am seeing alternative media find reports and stories about how the vaccine is causing terrible health problems and deaths to healthy people, who were at virtually no risk from Covid itself. I am seeing reports about How the vaccine doesn't really seem to stop people from catching or spreading Covid. i've seen these reports for months but Only now is the main stream media starting to cover the fact that the vaccine isn't really working as the experts claimed it would and now they are calling for more lockdowns and a social cred- *cough cough* ahhem sorry... *vaccine passport*


ironically, i remember the whole start of it. in late january 2020, I remember going to my parents place, and walking out to the garage and seeing the bed of my dad's truck filled with groceries. I remember asking my mom why the fuck she bought so much groceries. She started telling me about this dangerous virus from China, there was killing people in droves. She proceeded to send me a 40 minute video of some crusty ass doctor blathering on and on about some sort of unknown virus in China.

I remember laughing at her, and telling her that this is overhyped, just like how the swine flu and the bird flu and a bola voiceover he. She insisted it wasn't.

I remember when Covid finally did come to Canada, and then came to Alberta. I remember how scared people were, because of the news. I remember being starting to be nervous about it, I remember buying masks and wearing them in late March, just in case. I remember being nervous based on the sheer volume of scary things about the death rates I was hearing on the news. 

I remember getting laid off and finally having enough time to start doing some of my own research. I remember being how frustrated I was with Google because I couldn't get an relevant search results, and having to go to DuckDuckGo to get things I was looking for. I remember finding a lot of  evidence saying that the masks were doing nothing, and that people were over hyping the severity of Covid. I remember finding very logical, very scientific arguments on why things like lockdowns and masks are not very effective, and later on in the year finding out that most of the population is not under severe risk for Covid complications and or death. 

The final nail in the coffin was that most of the Covid deaths where from people living in care facilities,  who are 80 years old and have health conditions...Someone should tell Governor Cuomo that.

I remember watching people raising valid issues  against the mainstream narrative, I remember watching these people get censored. and called bigots and Trumpists. I remember people saying ""I can't wait till we get the vaccine because the vaccine is going to be amazing and it's going to stop covid. I remember people saying ""oh Trump is making a vaccine? I'll never get that; it won't be safe."" I remember stupid bejing Biden claiming that the Covid vaccine wasn't going to be safe. 

I remember people talking about the false positives on Covid test, and how said Covid tests where having a hard time differentiating between the common cold/flu and actual Covid. I remember a coworker telling me I was an idiot,  believing that the PCR test couldn't actually tell the difference between cold/flu and Covid.

I just keep laughing my ass off, when I suddenly see the news finally forced to cover stories on the PCR test not being able to effectively test for Covid, and making stories about how the vaccine seems to be doing fuck all, If not making it easier for people to die from Covid and other issues.

the government doesn't do anything unless it benefits them, so how is it benefiting them? personally, I think that governments utilize the Covid pandemic and lockdowns, for the great reset plans; they want a social credit system, they want millions of people to be on welfare and basically make these people dependant on the government, and to hate the people who tell them that they need to earn what they have. 

I think the authoritarian socialists are overjoyed. They want a welfare state, where everyone is tracked even more than they already are, and they can censor whatever they feel like, under the guise of ""misinformation."" I feel like both government and big Pharma are set to make billions, if not trillions, off of Covid vaccines. And the billionaires just continue to get more and more wealthy. I don't know if Covid was intentionally preplanned, but I know that the government and the ultra wealthy are using it to their advantage.


In the end, I have worked 3 different jobs since 2020. I have a hard time keeping a job for longer than six months. most of the places I end up working at are wage-cuck asshole jobs with high turnaround rates. I know a lot of people from these jobs, I've also moved three times. I know and have a lot of neighbours and friends. I personally only know 2 or3 people who have actually directly gotten sick with Covid. I know even more people on discord,  Only two people have actually gotten sick as well. I do not know a single person who has died from Covid, most of my friends do not know a single person who has died from Covid  either, it honestly makes it seem more like this has been overhyped.

Ironically, I have ripped bongs smokes joints vapes and cigarettes, shares water bottles, beer bottles, energy drinks, snacks, and food with people. I've smoked with absolute strangers. I'm given absolute strangers on the side of highways rides to gas stations to get gas for their cars. I've met hundreds and hundreds of people off of Facebook marketplace and kijiji to buy and sell things. ive shared tools and worked shoulder to shoulder with coworkers and friends. ive given so many rides to some many people. I have been into 2 relationships. I've basically lived life to the fullest for all of 2020 and 2021. I haven't caught Covid yet. I wore a mask only for a few weeks in early 2020 and only if I had to in the winter to get into stores when the government put a mask mandate in. I got sick of wearing a mask in April and just stopped wearing them, unless I had an employee ask me to put it on. 

Following the official narrative, I should've gotten Covid by now and should be on a ventelator, beging a nurse for a *""fauci ouchie""*. i should be dead. except Im not. Do I monitor my symptoms every day? yes. if I had symptoms I would avoid going out.

why am I celebrating this? im not. What I'm stating is that the narrative seems to be bunk because reality is objectively contradicting the narrative. What I did is not very much different from what most people are doing in my areas. Most people are not observing lockdowns and guidelines in my area. Do we have astronomically high Covid deaths? no. do We have astronomically high hospitalizations? also no. 

It's funny because the places with the strictest lockdown seem to be the case with most hospitalizations and deaths.

people shilling for covid vaccinations are fundamentally misunderstanding some key concepts. attempting to get me to get vaccinated is going to have the opposite effect; it will sour me to you, to your message, and to the very thing you are trying to convince me to do.

people making posts Like that one atrocity I saw the other day, begging us to get vaccinated so we can get our freedoms back, and shaming people for not getting vaccinated and calling them responsible. GTFO not even kidding. You completely misunderstand the concept of libertarianism and responsibility. Do you think you're gonna be able to bring your Normie r/covidvaccinated Reddit-trash (spend too much time on4chan) arguments onto this subreddit and think people are just gonna do what you want?

*tHe VaCcInE iS sAfe. gEt iT.* idk Where get off thinking that you can tell me what to do with my body. i'm not getting a  experimental vaccine just because you're scared and ""want things to go back to normal."" Obedience has never lessened the grip of tyrants and authoritarians. Your obedience to a illogical narrative is prolonging this nightmare. We will not get our freedoms back unless we take them back by force. 

*JuSt GeT a VaCcInE sO wE cAn GeT oUr FrEeDoMs BaCk* Like do I need to actually say anything to this, this type of thinking is so,so wrong on so many fundamental levels. I can't even believe that someone would say something so asinine and against the spirit of libertarianism in this subreddit, like are you actually a mental defect?

fine go ahead and get vaccinated if you feel like it, I don't believe anyone should shame you for doing it. Your body your choice. If you get are getting the vaccine because you actually want to help people and help the problem, good on you. I admire that you care and you want to do what you believe is the right thing. I may not agree with it, but I respect the reasons why you were doing it. 

But it's a whole 'nother animal to tell me what you think I should do, based on some flimsy bullshit the government calls ""factual"" but keeps changing over and over again. I don't believe the ""facts"" that the government is giving, I don't believe that the data is unmanipulated, and I don't believe that there's no motive behind the claims of the government.

I saw both, Trump and Biden archetypes in this show and realized the next authoritarian takeover will be slightly different from the ones in the past. Even if we learn from history, that doesn’t mean we will be able to escape repeating it because people love being governed. 
 
Throughout history, humans have leaned into authoritarianism, especially during times of adversity, and times of adversity are always sure to arrive.  We want voluntary contributions to be the way we handle issues in this country but more than 50% of any population wants to blame someone else.  

We are on the right path and it is worth fighting to the death to secure individual liberty, but this idea is foreign, difficult to obtain, and unacceptable to most of the worlds’ population. 

I’ve seen people talk about left libertarian and right libertarian. Those folks can’t seem to see eye to eye and they are together in a very small subset of any voter base in the US. If we had a charismatic leader that took advantage of their position during a terrible situation, then we would coalesce around them, but a number of us would reject them as a leader because, well, most of us are anti-authoritarians. 

I will continue to fight authoritarianism locally, pressure local authorities to leave people alone, try to spread the ideas of liberty among acquaintances, vote gold when I can, and hope that everyone realizes the American Experiment was successful but requires continual support from it’s participants.",0,0.151,0.707,0.142,-0.6158
1941,"“John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it.” -Andrew Jackson So Dems let the Eviction Moritorium run out knowing that the Supreme Court ruled on it and said for an extension there had to be legislation on it.  They did nothing, Nada, zilch and to be clear they control everything.  With like 3 minutes left on the clock the big Nasty calls for a unanimous vote to approve an extension.  Meaning one Republican objects and it doesn't go through.  I’m not just knocking Dems here because of you think Cocaine Mitch would let that go through you you haven’t been paying attention.  So of course a Republican objects.  

It seems even though the Supreme Court ruled that there would have to be legislation on it Biden got on the magic box and and said he knows it’s unconstitutional but he is going to do it anyway because by the time it goes to court it will be too late.  Translation for Mr Magoo:  He is admitting openly, to an unconstitutional power grab that will not pass muster in a court of law and by the time that courts can do anything about  it, it will be late.  

On the housing assistance stipends or government aid, the renters have to work with the landlords for the landlord to actually receive payment.   As an owner of a past rental house It’s almost impossible to evict renters even without the moratorium.  It took almost a year and when I finally got them out they tried to take me to court and I had to drop $40,000 in the property in order to sell it.  

Anyway a lot of  these “horrible” landlords will be going bankrupt if not during the moratorium then after it’s over if it ever is.  Because how many of these renters will be able to pay back the past rent they owe.  Again, if you don’t think Republicans are going to do it when they get back in office you haven’t been paying attention.  

  Which means that there are going to continue to be property for sale and a lot more of it.  Which works out great for BlackRock who is gobbeling up property left and right.  I’m not going to waste your time going into the revolving door of BlackRock executives in the Biden administration.  

I will point out three though, Biden’s Chief Financial Advisor Brian Deese (who until Dec. 18 led sustainable investing at BlackRock).  Kamala’s chief financial advisor is Mike Pyle (BlackRocks former Chief Investment Strategist).  Wally Adeyemo the Deputy Treasury Secretary (who worked at BlackRock for just over two years, including as an interim chief of staff to founder Larry Fink) 

The CDC has assumed the power to write legislation and has removed property rights from millions of Americans in the process.  Property rights one of the most fundamental rights you can have.  If you don't have property rights then you don't have rights.  (Which we don’t, in my opinion we have privileges until the ruling class decides to take them away).  If you don't have property rights you don't have a free country.  Meanwhile Republicans are not doing shit. If this were in Cuba they might give a shit and actually do something.

To me this is what an oligarchy looks like and we are running around bickering about, to mask or not to mask, To jab or not to jab.  Or the cyber ninjas found some nonsense.   All the while the Federal Government through the CDC is taking property rights away from millions Americans,  even though the law (Court) said no.  It would seem John Adams was wrong.  We are not a Nation of laws. 

To be crystal clear it is well past time to wake up from the petty tribal bickering and pay attention.  If you stuck with me this long thanks for listening.  I found this very cathartic.

Many other media companies site these papers as sources because they don't have many journalists of their own.

I find it very disturbing that the Washington Post is owned by a military contractor. Amazon web services is owned by Jeff Bezos, and Amazon web services just got a 10 billion dollar contract with the National Security Administration. Amazon has done work for the CIA in the past.

I can't help but feel that when a major and influential newspaper - one that I love I might add - harshly criticizes a president for ending a military boondoggle that my liberty is threatened. 

If the Washington Post were too critical of US military missions - Would Amazon be as likely to receive government contracts?

It is known that the CIA seeks to and does operate through the US media. Is it possible that it is influencing the Washington Post's coverage of the Afghanistan mission? Should Americans be alarmed?

The Washington Post's revenue is less than a billion dollars - far less than the value of bezos's defense contracts. Could access to The Washington Post be part of the deal?

&gt;**THE PRESIDENT:**  That is not true. 

&gt;**Q**    Is it — can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not? 

&gt;**THE PRESIDENT:**  That is not true.  They did not — they didn’t — did not reach that conclusion. 

&gt;**Q**    So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse? 

&gt;**THE PRESIDENT:**  The Afghan government and leadership has to come together.  They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place.  The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it?  It’s not a question of whether they have the capacity.  They have the capacity.  They have the forces.  They have the equipment.  The question is: Will they do it? 

&gt;And I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus- — walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force.  We are.  We’re going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in — in the region.  But — but, there’s not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban. 

&gt;I believe the only way there’s going to be — this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community — the only way there’s ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace.

One might argue that this was from July 2020, and is thus not urgent or likely anymore, but the Biden administration and its allies have been using extremely aggressive language against the unvaccinated, and this was foreshadowed in 2016 (during Obama) by [the CDC asking Congress for the power to indefinitely detain an unlimited amount of people](https://endofinnocence.com/cdc-expands-police-state-indefinite-detainment/), and countries like Australia have already begun doing something much like this--for humanitarian reasons of course.

First, let me say, ""When have the book burners ever been the good guys?""

Second, Covid-19 is less deadly than the flu for working-age people.

Third, ""We will not go to the camps.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things  have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night  to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and  had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass  arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of  the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling  with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on  the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had  boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people  with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs  would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport  and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would  have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even  more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and  simply deserved everything that happened afterward.

We all can agree we should’ve never been there to begin with- but to leave our equipment and put evil at such advantage was pure negligence- although none of us expected anything different from our Former Vice President, Joe Biden. 
We all agree that we shouldn’t be policing other countries- but I’m sure we can all agree how stupid it was to leave without a plan. 
If there was a plan- it was definitely to leave the taliban at an advantage.

I don't understand how people cannot clearly see the one sided bias, masquerading as caring about liberty.  Even if we disagree about the moral function of govt, why not be intellectually consistent, and weigh pro/con stories and events equally, between left and right.

1982,"We’re heading towards a civil war / flawed democratic government after 2024 and everyone is in denial about it Trump is the main figurehead of the Republican Party, despite no longer being in office and being banned from mainstream social media platforms. His views hold significant influence over the rest of the Republican Party. Trump has incorrectly concluded and publicized the belief that the election he lost in 2020 to Joe Biden was stolen from him via means of voter fraud, corruption, and subversion. Despite being unable to prove his belief, Trump and has taken actions to subvert the democratic process in order to damage and hinder the democratic process.

Because Trump has such significant influence over Republican beliefs, much of the Republican base agrees with and supports his views, and do not see Joe Biden as the legitimate leader of the United States. More importantly, this same base views any politicians that challenge trump, Democratic or Republican, as corrupt traitors. This came to a head on January 6th, where dozens of Trump supporters attempted to upend the democratic process be haunting the process of electors vote certification. While they failed, it became clear in the following months where the Republican base stood on the issue. And most important of all , the Republican Party as a whole has realigned itself to match the base, and now espouse the election fraud hoax as a mainstream position; either out loud or complicity by refusing to reject / challenge it for fear of the stability of their careers.

The United States as a nation cannot continue to survive as a country if the population is so polarized to the point that a significant minority does not believe the elections are free and fair. This minority has enough influence to the point that the party that represents this minority is now taking actions that will allow it in the future to reject election results based on a conspiracy theory that has yet to be proven.

This will, and is, breaking the entire political system. This WILL lead us to civil war when the next time there is a candidate that loses, but has the election results rejected based on loopholes currently being implemented.",0,0.099,0.813,0.088,-0.8783
